Read about their simple and effective model, which has enabled them to enrol thousands of volunteers and help scores of NGOs across the globe in just two years!', 'Code4Cause is a Chennai based Non-Profit Organization which aims to support budding and existing NGOs in the field of Information Technology and progress models. It was founded by Arun Rajiah, in the year 2011 when he was working with Cognizant, and soon this new wave turned into a tide engulfing many young minds including individuals from not only the IT sector but many different fields. Code4Cause is on a mission to help society with the intellectual property that they own. They have been using resources of their own to help NGOs and often participate in the cause themselves to help it grow. ‘Let’s Code and make the NGO’s life easier’, goes their motto.', 'The Beginning\nCode4Cause started off by helping those who help the needy; therefore at first they started helping their friends who were already involved in charitable activities. They wanted to contribute to their achievements in some way and then decided to contribute with what they were best at, and hence came up with the concept of Code4Cause. Their major works are in areas of creation and maintenance of websites for NGOs, building software applications for NGOs and providing them with consultation in matters such as digital marketing, fundraising and skill development.', 'At the time of its initiation, Code4Cause started as a small team and since then, has continuously spread throughout the globe. Today, it comprises of thousands of volunteers not only from India but from all over the world. Code4Cause is also supporting NGOs from all around the world. It partners with NGOs in India, South Africa, Ghana, US, China, Pakistan and Kenya. Code4Cause has achieved this milestone in less than two years.', 'How It Works\nCode4cause runs virtually, and the meetings and interviews with the volunteers or NGOs are mostly taken on Skype or google hangout. They mostly use the social networking sites to get more volunteers involved in the projects that are taken up and Free Media Marketing is generally used for spreading awareness. As the team never really meets the NGOs or volunteers, keeping the volunteers engaged and making sure that the product is delivered on time are the major challenges faced by them.', 'Among many other open source communities around the world developing software for free, the volunteers at Code4Cause do it for free because they love it. The work culture in Code4Cause is very different as it involves various roles for all volunteers according to their choices and provides a lot of experience to the volunteers. It’s not just a startup culture but a lot more than that as the volunteers work closely with the NGOs, understand their problem and start coding. There are no project managers or deadlines for the projects but the pleasure of giving and an achievement of satisfaction by helping humanity are the biggest motivations for the volunteers.', 'We are lucky enough to get good education, stay in houses which are safe in natural calamities, enough food to satisfy our hunger, but not many are born this lucky. It was just a selfless thought or rather a realization of humanity that made us think beyond materialistic pleasures. None of our volunteers are paid a salary in code4cause – it’s just their sheer honesty and humanity which makes them dedicate their valuable time and their education for the people who need.', 'Future Plans\nTheir future plans involve extending their services to all parts of the globe to help NGOs achieve their goals in a better manner. They are currently working on a model in which they have dedicated people assigned to each NGO associated with Code4Cause who will provide them assistance in information technology as well as in business models and fund raising activities.', 'Additionally, Code4Cause is working on an e-commerce platform where they aim to showcase talents from all over the world who are not getting a proper market to display their talents. This platform would be free of cost and would help the grass root initiatives and talents to get the right value of their efforts by eliminating the middle men. Partnership with like-minded organizations is being forged to strengthen the movement. Efforts are also being made to create Code4Cause centers across India and invite technology students to work in their projects and deliver better solutions to the social problems.', 'In our extremely information-centric age, the technology and design community carries a tremendous influence over the success of an organization. Unfortunately, it’s often the case that very simple and implementable tools and communication methods which could dramatically improve a non-profit’s ability to fulfill its mission are out of reach. Code4Cause is indeed a great initiative looking after such issues. Volunteer in this first and largest IT Non-Profit in India to make a difference.

Called ‘Half Stories – The Journey of Doing Right’ because the other half of the story is going to be scripted by ordinary people like you and me, who can come forward to help the people in need realise their dreams and improve their lives. This is part of their ‘Do Right’ initiative which aims to both inspire people to ‘do right’ as well as encourages them to participate in the problems of the society at large, and make a difference', 'The Half Stories journey of 2000kms has commenced from Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh, and is going to end at Guwahati in Assam. In the first of these half stories, we meet Atmaram, a shepherd belonging to a fast-shrinking community of the Gaddi tribe of nomads in Himachal Pradesh. During summers, as the land dries up, these shepherds have to hike up 15,000 feet in search of greener pastures for their sheep. Says Atmaram', '“I was 13 years old when I started tending to these sheep with my father. Earlier there were many of us who used to do this work, but we are soon becoming extinct. The conditions are tough. It sometimes snows for 2-3 days continuously and then we don’t even get tea along the way. We just have to survive on goat’s milk.”', 'Atmaram faces a constant threat of his sheep being stolen or eaten by wild animals. His dream is to own a tent and a few lights which can help him and his flock survive the harsh weather conditions, be safe from wild animals and allow him to cook food along the way. With paltry earnings of Rs.80 per day, it is difficult for him to fulfil his basic needs. We can help provide him with a survival kit of tent, 2 solar lights and 2 sleeping bags, which will together cost Rs.11,500.', 'If you’d like to complete Atmaram’s half story, feel free to contribute an amount or share this initiative.

Some are doing excellent grass-root work and a few are pioneering social innovations. However, most of the NGOs either fail to scale up or sustain themselves after a decade or so. Be it the shift of focus, lack of new people & ideas or impact of external politics – these institutions stop expanding. Fortunately, there are exceptions too. I come across a century old establishment, which is not only expanding its domains of work but also increasing the number of beneficiaries each year.', 'Ramakrishna Mission Students’ Home (RMSH) in Mylapore, Chennai stands tall with its decades of contribution to the society. The organisation with its principle firmly rooted in the teachings of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekanenda that service to man is service to God was established in 1905. As an ardent disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Ramakrishnanda founded RMSH with 5 orphan kids. Initially, the aim was to provide free board and lodging for destitute and orphan boys allowing them to have their education in a nearby school. Later for a fuller realisation of the Gurukula ideal, a residential high school was started in 1922.', 'The Students Home is located at P.S. Sivaswamy Salai in Mylapore. RMSH comprises of four components namely, Residential High School, Residential Polytechnic College, Collegiate Section and Centetary Primary School (for girls & boys). The last one is a day school where kids are transported daily from their homes and are given free education along with free mid-day meal. At present, there are nearly 700 students studying in RMSH. They are provided free education, board & lodging. Almost all activities of the Home, like cleaning, washing, upkeep of the surroundings, serving food in the dining halls, maintenance of the gardens, management of the stores, maintenance of electrical installations, computers and water pumps, library management etc., are carried out by the boys themselves under the overall supervision of the wardens and teachers.', 'Our ancient scriptures mention that there are three types of services that are to be rendered to a man viz. Physical (food, clothing & shelter), Intellectual (learning, reasoning & concentration) and Spiritual (to manifest his real nature). In RMSH all these services are given equal importance.', 'Since its inception, thousands of poor students have been rehabilitated. All of them reached self-fulfillment both materially and in the finer graces. In as much as they feel and declare that their stay in the Home shaped their attitudes for the betterment of their lives, the Home considers its efforts have been amply rewarded.', 'The most amazing work of RMSH is that each year they scout for orphan & destitute kids across Tamil Nadu. They bring in these buds, under the shelter of the home, nurture them, show them the right direction of life, encourage their compassionate nature and then help them pursue a good profession for livelihood. So many innocent lives could have gone astray if RMSH was not around. They give a normal life to a helpless kid instead of letting him be exploited by the social system. This kind of noble work certainly has a multiplier effect to the society. The institution has an Alumni of eminent men comprising internationally renowned professors, scientists, defence officers, philosophers, senior administrators (both in Government and outside), doctors, engineers, technicians and last but not the least, monks of the Ramakrishna order.', 'In its glorious history covering over a century, the Students Home gave rise to and promoted the growth of several organizations devoted to education of the weaker sections of the society.', 'RMSH is where spirituality enables selection of modern science and right policies', 'Contemporary Education: A new mathematics lab was inaugurated in the High School campus. Math Lab offers Multiple Teaching and Learning Aids as well as a complete theme-based ambience which helps students to visualize and feel mathematics. Science Park is a cluster of open air Science gadgets installed permanently to facilitate an easy way of learning science.', 'Technical Education: The Polytechnic College of RMSH was adjudged an outstanding educational institution during 2012 by the National Institution of Quality and Reliability. All the students who complete their Diploma courses were placed in different industrial establishments. Many reputed concerns (HCL, WIPRO, Ashok Leyland, Rane Group, Royal Sundaram, etc.) carried out campus interviews and took their students for further training and eventual employment.', 'Community Service: Senior hostel students clean up premises of the temples located outside the RMSH campus during festivals. Sponsored by GoI, RMSH has been carrying out ‘Sustained Graded Value Education Programmes’ for 11 schools, touching 450 students’ lives.\nEnvironmental Initiatives: A solar photo voltaic power system of 5KVA has been installed on the terrace of the Polytechnic college.', 'Rural Development Programme: The Home has launched ‘Vivekanenda Swasthya Parisheva Prakalpa’ to fight child malnutrition, and to give preventive and curative medical care to the needy mothers and children in the nearby villages of Madayambakkam & Perumalcherry in Kanchipuram district. RMSH has started ‘Gadadhar Abhyudhya Prakalpa’ in a slum near Kathivakkam, Ennore with a view to facilitate all-round devolopment for socially & economically deprived children. Currently 100 needy children are under the ambit of this programme.', 'Lastly, I would like to mention about one of the oldest students of the home – Mr. S. P. Srinivasan. Seven decades ago, a kid without home, parents & shelter, was brought to the Home from rural Tamil Nadu. The kid completed his studies, got a T.N. government job, and fullfilled all his responsibilities as an ideal father, husband and employee. Once retired, he was back to his ‘home’. He is 82 years old now, and still serving the Home each day. The home has produced such extraordinary personalities. This makes me feel confident that RMSH will continue contributing to the society in the coming days. In fact, we need more institutions like this, and many selfless students like Mr. Srinivasan for a better world.', 'The Home has just completed 108 years of useful service to the student community. In RMSH, old values are still afresh, brotherhood is abundant, service is carried out with joy, and above all the Home strives to inculcate the values of humanity in all. This makes me call the place a palace, where you find richness in the quality of lives.', 'P.S.

3,2013-11,"['Archives', 'TBI Innovations: The Mechanical Fridge – Freezing Environmental Damage']","['\n\n\nby\n\nIpsita Sarkar\n\n\nNovember 20, 2013, 9:58 am \n\n\n', 'Narendra Patil, a third year engineering student from Karnataka and his fellow mates tapped the positive side of technology and their engineering knowledge, to come up with a unique model of an eco-friendly refrigerator. It not only runs without electricity but can also be available to the poor as an inexpensive and necessary utility option and no longer as a luxury one meant only for those with large pockets. Hence, with one shot, the special refrigerator addresses the dual issues of ‘economic availability to the poor’ and ‘sustainable ecological development’.', 'Technology is indeed like a two-sided coin. While we can go gung-ho about technological progress and how it has simplified our lives, we can also talk about in the same breath about the adverse effects of technology, particularly on the environment. Take the refrigerator, for example. It is a remarkable technological offering that has made our lives a lot cooler. We are able to keep food fresh, preserve fruits, vegetables and dishes for longer, relish cold food items in blistering temperatures and most importantly make the good ol’ ice. But the refrigerator too has two sides to it. One, that of necessity and two, that of the environmental degradation that it can cause by consuming power and emitting CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) into the ozone layer, thus depleting it and leading to global warming. Clearly, what is required is a neutral zone wherein a refrigerator is available to all, yet with minimal adverse environmental impact.', 'This was what motivated the third year Engineering student from BEC College, Bagalkot, Karnataka, Narendra Patil to come up with this interesting model of a refrigerator. The idea started off as their topic for the final year project. Obviously, it was not just the marks that the design could fetch, it was also the delightful revolution that this could bring about, something that Narendra and his fellow batch mates, Anil and Murthy were very proud about – of making the refrigerator an affordable and economical choice and not just a luxurious one among even the lower income population. The reason behind its cost efficiency is its zero power consumption and no requirement of fossil fuels to burn the planet in the process of cooling. Narendra recalls:', 'We live in the North geographical region of Karnataka, where temperature is usually high in summer (35-39 degrees celsius). Back in college we used to have our practicals in workshops, where we used to get exhausted by the time we finished. After finishing the practicals, I used to go to a cold drink shop and have soda even though I knew it was not good for health, but I didn’t have an option because I didn’t have a fridge in my room. Then a thought struck me that what would be the state of those poor who didn’t even have money to buy a cold drink. Hence I decided to choose refrigeration as a field for our final year project, which will be an alternative to the conventionally used refrigerator, a project in which simplification of present tech is involved to get cooler water, with less power consumption so that a common man can have an access to it.', 'Interestingly, another technological accomplishment in the arena of social networking, YouTube, helped the trio in their cause. Narendra was inspired by the YouTube video, which was “Pedal powered Refrigerator using Zeolite-Water pair” and shared this with Anil and Murthy and thus began their journey to make their dreams a reality. They collected research papers and supporting documents in the seventh semester.', 'The working principle and the mechanism of the refrigerator is explained below in the budding engineer’s own words and supported by a diagram.', 'The refrigerator would work on the principle of adsorption. Adsorption occurs at the surface interface of two phases, in which cohesive forces including electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonding act between the molecules of all substances irrespective of their state of aggregation, causing changes in the concentration of molecules at the solid/fluid interface. Thus, adsorption is the adhesion of atoms, ions or molecules from a gas, liquid or dissolved solid to a surface. The adsorbing phase is the adsorbent, and the material concentrated or adsorbed at the surface of that phase is the adsorbate. In the designed refrigerator, zeolite is the adsorbent and methanol can be treated as refrigerant. This process creates a film of the adsorbate (methanol) on the surface of the adsorbant (zeolite).', 'The Hurdles\nOnce the design was put on paper, the real challenge lay in actualizing it with instruments, apparatus and raw materials. But here lay the glitch. The major items required were not available in their district. Even with exams nearing and project deadlines looming large over their heads, they travelled from store to store and went that extra mile.', 'The procurement started with getting the hero of the project, ie zeolite itself. Says Narendra:', 'Somehow we got the Zeolite retail seller address from Bengaluru, because most of the sellers we contacted were whole sellers who did their business in tons but our requirement was in few kgs only. But it was not the specification we intended, the seller said “that’s what he has and also the same is used in local Industries.', 'Some of their efforts were wasted too as the few apparatus they had bought earlier were hydraulic valves and not pneumatic valves. There were other challenges too and corresponding modifications done. Narendra explains:', 'Initially we built the Evaporator unit of GI-sheet, without internal support. While experimenting, it couldn’t sustain the vacuum we generated within it, as a result it compressed. Later we chose copper sheet with internal support. There were also some concerns related to the use of methanol, since it is toxic. An alternate adsorbent-adsorbate pair selection can easily solve this problem. Yet, we chose methanol replacing water because of failure in attainment of desired vacuum point to start the phase transformation which leads to adsorption phenomena.', 'Advantages and USPs\nApart from the refrigerator being inexpensive and not requiring any fossil fuels/power for its running, the refrigerator model presents the added advantage of not needing frequent maintenance, repairing or changing the system, since the life duration of their chosen adsorbent, zeolite is eternal and the entire working process is completely natural instead of mechanical. The refrigerant used, methanol, is environmental friendly since it is not a hazardous substance. Besides, the potentially portable and ‘hand run’ device can even be employed as a thermal energy storage device.', 'With further modification and up gradation, Narendra hopes that the refrigerator could be used in remote areas with lesser access to power. There are also many other essential purposes that such refrigerators could be utilized for apart from storing food, as Narendra points out. It could be used in medical camps (again in rural areas) for preserving vaccines and drugs and as water cooling units.', 'Limitations\nWhile confident about the pros of his refrigerator model, Narendra and his team simultaneously hope to address the cons of the model as well, to achieve the best possible efficiency. The limitations that they are working on include the low COP values, poor heat and mass transfer problem that poses a bottleneck to prevent the improvements of adsorption refrigeration technique, intermittently working principles, high technology requirement and special designs to maintain high vacuum.', 'Response and Road Ahead \nThe model completed, there were felicitations and applause from every corner. Narendra tells us proudly:', 'Our Project Guide was happy to see the results and appreciated our hard work. When we posted about the project on FACEBOOK we got very good response from our friends and relatives too.', 'Amidst all the happy stuff, their only regret is that they didn’t file their project idea for state level sponsorship programme, thus, missing out on the opportunity to showcase their project at the state level exhibition and get funding.', 'That said, they are their own critics and perfectionists. They have more plans up their sleeves for further modification, research and up gradation as they believe that the refrigerator can be made more sustainable and efficient than what it presently is, realizing their ultimate goal to serve the poor man’s demand in remote areas to preserve vaccine and food as one third of the Indian population doesn’t have access to power.', 'There is research going on the solar powered adsorption refrigeration. We did this prototype model with our UG capabilities and available sources within our reach and we can assure you that with more dedication , research and better design we can build a sustainable model.', 'We wish you all the best in this meaningful endeavour!', 'Click here to access the Project Report, and view their video here.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

And what started with just 500 schools has now spread to 4425 schools! Safeena Husain, the founder and Chief Executive Officer, tells us all about it.', 'Educate Girls started five years ago when Safeena Husain decided to promote girls’ education in rural Rajasthan. She designed a sustainable model where the whole community works hand in hand to enroll girls into government schools. As the whole community was meant to take part into the process, it was meant to succeed. No wonder, the number of school rose from 500 schools in 2008 to over 4,425 schools currently!', 'Safeena Hussain has always been committed to girls’ education in India and has worked extensively in this field even in the third-world countries of South America, Africa and Asia. The lady has been born and brought up in New Delhi and holds a B.S. from the London School of Economics. She has also been elected as one of the Asia 21 Young Leaders by the Asia Society. When asked about how and why she became so concerned about girls’ education, she replied thoughtfully:', 'I have always felt that when you educate a girl, you end up empowering the whole society. Educated women contribute to improving the whole community; they have fewer and healthier children, are three times less likely to be HIV+ and marry three years later. ‘Educate Girls’ envisions to achieve behavioral, social and economic transformation for all girls towards an India where all children have equal opportunities to access quality education. We started by reforming government schools for girls’ education. The idea was to leverage existing community and government resources so as to improve access and quality of education for 4 million children living in marginalized communities.', 'We asked Safeena to share about the kind of people who have been associated with ‘Educate Girls’. Has Indian youth and society’s intellectual population come forward to support the cause?', 'As Educate Girls welcomes all good will, we end up working with a wide variety of profiles. Most of our Team Balika members are young locals who feel strongly about the well-being of their community. They help enrolling girls into schools and assist teachers in the classroom. They usually volunteer with us several years and are well-respected inside their community. We try to open some volunteer positions to students from the cities and get them to participate in our communications campaigns.', 'Safeena also talked in detail about the TEAM BALIKA initiative.', 'Team Balika members are educated youth in the village who work as champions for girls’ education and catalysts for school reform. Team Balika animates the principles of ‘My Village, My Problem and I am the Solution’. They are at the core of our work in the field as they spread awareness on the importance of girl child education and strengthen girls enrollment, attendance and school management. We count an average of one Team Balika member per village where we operate.', 'Educate Girls has achieved tremendous success in Pali and Jalore village of Rajasthan and has recently started operations in Sirohi. In three years’ time, they are aiming at working in 6 gender-gap districts.', 'That means a total of 1.6 million children will be impacted and a whole society will be changed. Safeena elaborated on future plans:', 'We are about to open our programs in Sirohi, and will then launch in three other new districts starting in 2014. We rely on the communities and on the local government to scale. We help the villages improve their schools (adding female bathrooms and ensuring drinking water for instance), get parents to feel strongly about their daughter’s education and recruit dedicated volunteers in the field. After the activities are implemented over two years, Educate Girls works to handover the project to the community during the third year. By 2014, we aim to cover as many as 13,303 schools in 6 different districts. This means developing our programs in four new districts and recruiting more than 3,300 new Team Balika members to work in the field.', 'It is worth mentioning that Educate Girls has set up a sustainable funding model that requires 2.41 INR per child at the moment but will only require 1.36 INR in 2016 as the costs will be divided by a larger number of beneficiaries. The initiative is financed by government contribution and private funding (individual donors as well as philanthropic foundations) to manage their large portfolio of activities.', 'In anticipation of rapid budget expansion, the organization has instilled robust accounting, control and reporting systems to accurately measure cash flow, track expenditures and government receivables. Secondly, an impact assessment system has been implemented to track the effectiveness of Educate Girls’ efforts, provide formal reports to current and future donors, and most importantly, enable senior management and the board to improve upon existing implementation by closely monitoring the programs.', 'A noble initiative like this can never remain unrewarded and unappreciated! Educate Girls is a winner of the 3rd EdelGive Social Social Innovation Honors 2011, The World Bank’s India Development Marketplace award in the same year and the Dasra Village Capital award in 2010. The latest ones include Women Change Makers Award and Rotary’s Anita Parekh Award in 2012. But for Safeena, the biggest award is the public support she has garnered in all these years.', 'We all can be a part of this initiative as well; let us come forward to support and promote Educate Girls. We stand up against gender-based discrimination in education because we can empower the future generation of women in India only if we give them quality education.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Their parents thought the newly married will be back in Mumbai in a few days’ time. But it’s been eleven long years now – the couple have made Dahanu their home, contributing to the lives of the Warli tribes and to the ecology of this once barren land.', 'Dahanu, 120 kilometers off Mumbai, is home to the Warli tribes; ecologically fragile and largely ignored by what we call\xa0‘development’. Hemant had a piece of land there and by nurturing this land to become a lush chickoo orchard, they started a journey in steering Dahanu towards change. Hemant, a journalist, and Michelle, a social worker would have loved to have a quiet life of writing and farming in the idyllic village, but Dahanu refused to give them that.', 'There was a lot to be done. In every corner of Dahanu, the couple saw the opportunity to develop something or the other. Putting their experience together they decided to take a threefold approach for Dahanu – Education, Environment Protection and Community Media. So they went on to start a school, create organic farms, establish community radio and created an unparalleled ‘oral-history’ of the Warli tribes. Through these mediums they wanted to address the problems of social exclusion and lack of voice, which lie at the root of poverty.', 'Michelle took up the job of educating the tribal kids and started the Tamarind Tree School. Reluctant and skeptical as the tribe was, that Michelle got just a handful of students, including her two children, to start the school with. The classrooms were built to resemble the little village huts, reassuring the villagers that they needn’t worry about alienation. Slowly, the villagers started trusting the school and grew to have over 200 students. The children learn through play, speak English and are learning technology too. You’ll be surprised to hear that a 2nd standard student at Michelle’s School sends emails!', 'Michelle was clear that the service of the School will not be given for free and priced the fee at Rs 200/month. This was needed to create a sense of value and worth around education. This also meant that many parents found it difficult to fund their children’s education. This called for an initiative to economically empower the parents. Michelle and Hemant started a self-help group called ‘Gandhiana’ and encouraged the parents to practice organic farming. Introducing Gandhiana was to achieve two things – create entrepreneurs out of the tribal farmers and to support the delicate ecosystem of the village. Towards environment protection, they ran many campaigns to check pollution control and encourage judicial use of natural resources.', 'The history of the community is as fragile as its eco-system. The couple decided to record the voices of history that the tribe carried. Through their extensive initiative unfolded the folklore, myths, legends, wisdom, stories of exploitation, trauma of land grab, and stories that were clever and respectful of even the tiniest creatures on earth. You can get a glimpse of the Oral History Project on Youtube.', 'While they recorded the history of the tribes, they also thought it was equally important to give a voice to the present time of the tribes. This initiated the community radio project in Dahanu. Hemant became a self-taught technician on Radio Frequency and Air waves. Discovering that technology can help us re-think and transform our social relations, he went on found an organization called Nomad India – the only one in the non-governmental private sector that manufactures transmission system for community radio stations. Michelle says,', 'The joke goes that Hemant’s farm has transmitters hanging from the trees rather than chikoos. Following the success of Community Radio in Dahanu, Nomad has gone on to set up more than 30 community radio stations in villages across India. Hemant is currently developing a wi-mesh network for the school that will be beamed across the village and children will get access to digital content at home. He believes in the power of technology to reduce social exclusion.', 'Thanks to the numerous initiatives of Michelle and Hemant, Dahanu has a refreshing milieu today that is empowered with knowledge, media, technology, and a healthy environment. May the tribe of such change makers grow!', 'For more information on Tamarind Tree, visit – www.tamarindtree.org\nWatch The world of Warli Tribes\xa0and\xa0The Oral History Project', 'Impact Update on 8/1/2014: We are happy to hear from Michelle that Tamarind Tree got a tremendous response from readers of The Better India.

Read how.', 'Yenepoya Medical and Dental College, some 15 kilometres away from Mangalore city near Delarekatte, is located in a developing neighbourhood; three other medical colleges, many schools and the Mangalore University are all situated in the same area. A software park is also expected to come up shortly. All this has caused a sudden increase in the area’s population as well as in the demand for resources, specifically water.', 'The college that spans 33 acres is located on a hilltop. It had already started experiencing water scarcity and depended on water from tankers for almost eight months of the year. A few lakh Rupees were being spent annually to pay for the tankers. This was a few years ago.', 'That was when the decision to harvest rainwater was made. Narayana Bhatji, the manager of this water harvesting project says, “We started this project by consulting P. K. Thampi, a retired geologist from Trivandrum who helped us with the selection of the spot for digging the pond”.', 'A 3-acre wide and 6-7 feet deep pond was dug at the lowest elevation to catch the draining water or runoff from the campus. An embankment or a bund was constructed at the lower elevation of the pond to restrict the flow of water.', 'A plastic Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) sheet was inserted in the middle of this bund to prevent seepage. The sides of the pond were covered by coir material to prevent the sand from getting inside the pond. An interesting thing about this effort is that the dugwell from which water is drawn out for daily use is located right in the middle of the pond. Besides the dugwell, there are two borewells on campus to meet the needs of both the medical and dental colleges. The open well is 25 feet deep while the two borewells are 40 feet deep.', 'Around 100,000 litres of water is pumped from the well and 457,000 litres from both the borewells each day. Narayana Bhatji proudly says, “This makes us self sufficient for around 5 to 6 months. However, we still have to get around 4000 litres of water by four tankers on the campus”.', 'The campus also has three sewage treatment plants where water from the hostels and other quarters is treated and pumped back. This is used for irrigation and for flushing the toilets. The whole garden in the campus area is watered using this recycled water.', 'Rainwater harvesting at the hostel/residential complex', 'Another rainwater harvesting pond has been dug near the hostel and the residential complex of the medical college. This pond is around 6 – 7 feet deep and is surrounded by a fence. The roads surrounding the residential complex have been excavated and now slope in order to collect all the water that drains from the surrounding areas. This is collected by pipes that open into the pond.', 'Yenepoya Medical College has demonstrated that with determination and the inclination to be self-sufficient, organisations with large campuses such as medical colleges, hostels, housing colonies, factories and schools can go a long way in solving their water scarcity problems by developing sustainable models by using rainwater harvesting. This will greatly reduce the monetary burden that most such institutions currently face due to over dependence on water tankers.', 'Acknowledgements\nThe author is grateful to Shri Padreji for introducing her to this effort made by the Yenepoya Medical College. She is also grateful to Narayana Bhatji for taking her around and showing her the efforts undertaken by the college.', 'For any further information on this effort, Narayana Bhatji can be contacted at this number: +91 9845167855', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
8,2013-11,"['Archives', 'Citizens Come Together To Make Their Locality And Environment Clean']","['\n\n\nby\n\nSanjay Dave\n\n\nNovember 8, 2013, 10:03 am \n\n\n', 'It can be seen from the examples below that when residents and stakeholders in a community come together to solve an issue, the results are not only positive, but also long-lasting. Here we learn of ordinary citizens and local NGOs who inspired people in their areas to keep their surroundings clean and free of diseases.', 'When a work is considered as one’s own, then it sustains for a longer duration. This factor is also applicable in Health and Sanitation. The Gujarat state government has implemented ‘Nirmal Gujarat’ scheme. But for a long-term implication and effect, people have to take ownership of their environment. When people understand their roles and responsibilities towards a clean environment, only then any scheme becomes a success. In many places, people have come together to keep their lanes, villages or city clean.', 'A similar effort was made in Nehrunagar slum located opposite to Bus depot on Hatkeshwar Mahadev temple road at Amrawadi. There are around 2000 slum dwellings mainly occupied by migrants of Nadiya and Waghari community. People from Maharashtra and southern India are also staying here. The residents earn their income by collecting paper and waste which are kept outside homes. They separate the saleable paper from the waste and the rest stays there. Wind scatters the waste to nearby regions. The entire area becomes dirty and unhygienic, all this leads to skin problems, infections in eyes and other diseases. A lot of expense is borne for the treatment of these diseases. Malnutrition is common and excessive unhygienic condition leads to epidemics.', 'It becomes difficult to implement cleanliness drives in these regions. A local NGO made the residents understand the importance of cleanliness. Epidemics and diseases spread through such an environment, regular cleaning is the only way out. Men shrugged away from cleaning as they believed it’s a woman’s job. The volunteers of the NGO continued with the behavioral change communication activities. During that time the Municipal Corporation was also on a cleanliness drive. The volunteers were determined to make the impossible happen. On a fixed date they involved local youths, women and the elderly in the cleanliness drive. The staff of the Municipal Corporation also supported them in the cause. Within days the entire slum of Nehrunagar transformed into a new place. A truck full of waste was gathered from the slum. With a view to maintaining the hygiene of the place, two dustbins were put up. Local residents are demanding more dustbins now, as they say “We don’t feel shame in cleaning up the place. Clean environment makes one healthy, and we are protecting our health.”', 'In the Sabarmati area of Ahmedabad city, people have created a garden where a garbage dump used to be. Huge waste had accumulated near the vegetable market of Ramnagar. The vendors of the vegetable market and the residents of nearby areas were fed up of the waste. Hemant Vyas, a young man had returned from Canada after several years. He is working as a lecturer in a college at Judaal. His home is adjacent to the market. The waste from a nearby hospital was also dumped in the area. It became difficult to stay in those conditions. The learnings from staying in a clean environment at Canada were instilled strongly. He decided to take up the issue and started meeting government officials at the Municipal Corporation.', 'Hemant and his group of friends who were doctors by profession also took up the issue and their efforts showed results. The officers at the corporation helped in removing the waste from the vegetable market. The cleanliness drive started and Hemant led from the front. The drive saw participation of doctors, vegetable vendors and residents from the area. The entire area was cleaned and to prevent recurrence Hemant, along with his friends, developed a park and built a public toilet. The garden was developed by people planting small and big plants. Today it is known as ‘Sai Garden’ and is a favourite place for the kids of the locality.', 'The video below (\xa0by RedFM in Ahmedabad)\xa0tells the story of how Hemant went about converting the garbage dump near his house to a green spot. (Note: The video is in Gujarati)', 'Like Hemant, if all citizens are determined for a clean and hygienic environment, the lanes, villages and entire cities will become clean. Some time earlier, Municipal Commissioner of Surat Mr. Rao, with his vision for a clean city, changed the entire landscape and appearance of Surat. The villages have also now taken up the cause of a cleaner and healthier environment.', 'In Vasada Village of Surendranagar, there was only one water tank and no bathing ghats for women. A WASMO (Water and Sanitation Management Organization) programme started in the village, and with the support of SWATI (Society for Women’s Action and Training Initiatives) organization, bathing ghats for women were made and the water problem was resolved.', 'The drive for clean environment still needs to be propagated widely. Organizations like WASMO and SWATI conduct regular meetings with women in the villages to generate awareness about a better environment. They are asked questions like who will maintain places like tanks, stand posts and bathrooms. They are taught that if the village is kept clean then people will not feel sick, work can be done properly and money spent on medicines can be saved.', 'Three women volunteered to take up the issue. In every lane dustbins were installed on posts. Proper collection and disposal of waste is put to place. Women took the responsibility for each task. The cleanliness drive began from one’s house and lane. Drainage system has been implemented for waste water disposal. This way Vasada village is on the path to a clean environment.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
9,2013-11,"['Archives', 'TBI Social Enterprise: Kipepeo – Promoting Responsible Tourism In The North East']","['\n\n\nby\n\nAnusha Subramanian\n\n\nNovember 6, 2013, 2:27 pm \n\n\n', '‘Responsible tourism’ is a lot more than just “not littering” It is about connecting with the local people and their culture, about leaving the environment in a better state than before, about improving lives of the locals, about giving more than taking, and much more. A travel company that operates in North East India is trying to be ‘responsible’. Let’s find out how.', 'All of us have dreamt of going to the North East sometime, but very few of us actually end up going to these beautiful hills. It’s a fascinating land shrouded in mystery and many intriguing stories of the area and its various tribes. It’s known as the Seven Sisters comprising of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram and Meghalaya. Now with Sikkim joining in, NE India consists of 8 states.', 'NE India on the one hand has the mighty Brahmaputra River and on the other the Khangchendzonga peak. This region represents the traditional zone between the Indian, Indo-Malayan and Indo-Chinese bio-geographic regions making it the geographical gateway for much of India’s flora and fauna.', 'Most people do not travel here due to fear of insurgency and lack of adequate information being available about the locals and their culture. And, it is this fear that Piran Elavia of Kipepeo is helping people get over by taking them to North East India and enabling them to experience the unspoilt richness of the region.', 'Interestingly, for Elavia too it started with fear. He too was scared of going to the North East initially. But, he was also keen on finding out more about the place to get over that fear. His quest to find out the truth of this place and his love for travel led him to take a sabbatical in 2008 from his well-paying and secure job in an IT company.', 'The software professional researched for a few days and found an NGO called ‘The Mountain Institute’ in Sikkim. The Mountain Institute seeks to preserve mountain environments and advance mountain cultures by promoting worldwide partnerships that create innovative and sustainable solutions to global mountain problems. He decided to volunteer for ‘The Mountain Institute’ and thus got an opportunity to know the people of North East and learn about its culture. It was not for too long though. Elavia volunteered for just 2 months, but the work got him totally involved with the project.', 'Thoroughly satisfied with his volunteering work, he came back to Mumbai to say a final goodbye to his job and to shift base to North East. “I left Mumbai one day after 26/11 happened and I had no idea what I was getting into,” says Elavia. He went back to volunteer for the Mountain Institute for another two months.', 'Describing his days in NE, Elavia describes that through the NGO that he was volunteering for he met some other people working on various projects in North East India, but the one he found most interesting was a project with the Bodo community in Assam.', 'In December 2008, I embarked into the project to work in the Bodo Areas. I was a bit apprehensive. But, to my pleasant surprise, after a few days of being there I realized that the opportunity had turned out to be a life changing experience. Being there and interacting with the Bodo people was different. Contrary to what I had heard about this community, I found them to be friendly and warm-hearted people.', 'I also worked with a local NGO name ManasMaouzigendri Tourism Society (MMES) for 4 months teaching computers to school kids and helping the NGO manage their small tourism camp. During this period, I learnt a lot about the Bodos and found that they had moved on with their lives after their armed struggle. My work with this community made me think about doing something for the Bodos and other North Eastern tribes at large.', 'Elavia continued working in the NE for close to two years gaining exposure in the area and local contacts. Finally, in 2010 he launched his own responsible tourism company called Kipepeo (lyrical name of the ‘Butterfly’ in Swahili language).', 'According to Elavia, Kipepeo believes tourism must be the happy face of conservation. Elavia has borrowed the name ‘Kipepeo’ from an enterprise by the same name in Kenya that successfully bridged the divide between conservation and livelihood of the local populace. Explains Elavia:', 'To us, here in India, those are the bridges we want to build and that is the balance we seek to create: between tourism and conservation, between equitability in society and sustainability of environment, between the quality of life for human beings and the quality of life around them, between enjoyment today and enjoyment tomorrow.', 'Explaining what responsible tourism is Elavia says, “Responsible tourism aims at increasing the positive impact of travel by enabling mutually enriching experiences between tourists and the environment, people and cultures they visit.”', 'Kipepeo’s first objective as a responsible tourism company is to strive to build bridges between resources and needs, leisure and livelihoods, visitors and hosts, in ways that are sustainable and beneficial to all. It has been involving the local communities actively in the tourism process, to assist them economically and socially. Secondly, Kipepeo’s objective is to highlight to the outside world this beautiful albeit misunderstood region of India.', '“I want to change the way people think about NE India and get their fear out. Instead I want people to visit these places and take back wonderful memories with them,” says Elavia.', 'Kipepeo’s multi faceted approach for developing a sustainable tourism model', 'Kipepeo offers tours in the North East in places such as Assam, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Nagaland. One can explore these places via treks and wildlife tours, caving in Meghalaya and home stays in Sikkim and Arunachal.', 'If you want to explore the Bailey’s Trail in Arunachal, or be in Nagaland for the Hornbill festival and get up close and personal with the local people and culture in these places, Kipepeo offers them all.', 'So, is it a profitable business? Elavia says, “The motive is to make it a sustainable venture.” Kipepeo offers both fixed departure tours as well as customized tours. The company currently operates through word of mouth publicity and engagement on social media. In the last three years, the company has had around 150 people taking these tours to various places in NE India and the business just about broke even in May 2013.', 'Going forward, Elavia’s goal is to bridge the gap between the North East India and the outside world.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
10,2013-11,"['Archives', 'TBI Diwali Special: Granny ‘Wicksdom’ – Wicks that light up the 100 Watt Smiles']","['\n\n\nby\n\nIpsita Sarkar\n\n\nNovember 1, 2013, 12:46 pm \n\n\n', 'Old age is revered here. Granny wisdom and the art of making wicks is celebrated at Wicksdom (Grandma Wicks). It is a passion that the Wicksdom project has tapped in order to not only provide a means of survival, but also to help the aged people live a life resplendent with dignity and happiness. As we celebrate the festival of lights, let us also celebrate a wonderful initiative that is lighting up old eyes.', 'A wall and windows of her room are the only things that Janakiamma, can see from her bed on which she lies in her old age home at Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala. A screen separates her from the rest of the inmates and the world. Bedridden, yet, she is able to visit temples, churches and thousands of people in several homes in India and abroad. How is this miracle achieved? Through the wicks she creates for ‘Ammoommatthiri’ or Grandma Wicks.', 'In spite of poor eyesight and her physical ailments, she cuts the thread with precision. Age hasn’t tired her nimble fingers. Instead, they work with child-like enthusiasm and produce marvelous wicks for candles. Janakiamma’s wicks travel miles and reach varied destinations. The other residents approach her and seek her help in getting the wicks made. The Wicksdom project, an initiative of Lakshmi Menon in Kerala, has ensured that the lives of several more grannies like Janakiamma are no longer lonely or boring.', 'They do so by engaging the elderly ladies living in poor homes in something they are passionate about, making oil wicks. It’s one of those activities that has been cultivated among the earlier generations right since their childhood. Today, in the old age homes, one of their favourite activities from the yester-years is helping them earn a livelihood while keeping their heads held up high. Says Lakshmi Menon:', 'We engage them to make wicks for oil lamps used in temples, churches and homes. Good Karma Foundation, our family trust, supplies them the raw material (cotton yarn) for free. In addition to the money they earn, this activity keeps them active and more lively. The happiness and pride in contributing to the society even at this age is priceless.', 'The idea brightened Ms Lakshmi’s mind like a lit candle that the wick supported in October 2012, when she saw her 89 year old grandma Bhavaniamma making wicks. From an activity to keep her granny occupied, it soon became something ‘more’ to satiate an inner child in her granny, as she started making extra wicks. One, it gave her immense delight to gift her handmade wicks to other children and relatives, feeling worthy that she was still able to do something for others. Two, thanks to the wicks she made she was able to reach the faraway temples in spirit that had physically been inaccessible.', 'Each long thick strand of thread can be separated into several thinner strands. It is cut to desired length. Those are then twisted gently with the fingers. 30 such wicks make one bunch. You will get up to 80 wicks from one long strand of thread.', 'The whole wick making process apart from having a socially and emotionally stimulating effect, also has a physical therapeutic effect on the health of the grannies. The thread twisting procedure lends an acupressure effect to the fingertips.', 'The Grandma Wicks team comprises of Lakshmi’s grandmother, mother, grandmas from four different old-age homes and Lakshmi herself. In fact, Lakshmi herself approached the old-age homes, some of which were run by the social welfare department of the Government of Kerala to enlist the support of the ladies. Lakshmi’s mother, Sreedevi is the one who contributes most towards the fulfillment of the project. She takes care of the nitty-gritties of sorting and packing with special attention on quality control. The packing, counting and labeling are done by her and Lakshmi’s grandma at home. And the fun, interest and togetherness is infectious as Lakshmi’s cousins and friends happily join the bandwagon of making the wicks whenever extra helping hands are required.', 'The power ladies comprising the Wicksdom team earn a decent amount to keep their heads held up high, doing what they love to do. Lakshmi explains the cost dynamics:', 'They make Rs.3 for 30 wicks. The process is so simple that they make 30 such bunches daily. But it is not a daily affair since marketing is not yet fully in place. We sell it at Rs. 5 which includes the cost of raw materials, packing materials, distribution and other related expenses. This is totally a non-profit initiative.', 'Although the total amount that the grandmas make may not boast of large digits, but it’s not just about the valuable paper notes for them. It’s about keeping themselves engaged in something fun everyday, working in groups, chatting, laughing and helping each other. They earn more than just money. Lakshmi recalls:', 'The manager of the old-age home (working with Wicksdom) called me up and said that the total atmosphere of that place has changed and the inmates are making plans to visit their relatives and even expressed their desire to carry gifts which they buy with their earnings, something which was totally unthinkable for them earlier. They had to borrow money from the staff earlier if they had to make any such visits.', 'The concept of old age homes is to provide assistance to the senior citizens and provide a shelter to them. Wicksdom goes a step further. Wicksdom respects their seniority and experience, and uses their own talent and skills to maintain a sense of self-respect and dignity – moving away from the concept of being dependent members of the society to becoming contributing members. The grannies by making the wicks are not just helping themselves financially and physically, but socially and psychologically they feel one with the society as contributing and needed members and no more as just dependent and helpless. End result, they are happy and smiling.', 'Help and support has come from all quarters in the most varied and unusual ways. For instance, Ravi D.C. of DC Books, a leading book publisher in Kerala purchased 3 lakh wicks from the Wicksdom initiative. They inserted the wicks as packs of 30 in each of the 10,000 copies of the epic Ramayana series that they published and sold in July 2013.', 'For better mileage and marketing, they approached the famous veteran actor and Southern superstar Mohanlal who unhesitatingly and wholeheartedly provided voice over for a documentary film on ‘Wicksdom’. The film is currently under production.', 'Apart from Wicksdom, Lakshmi has come up with an inspired variant called ‘Snehatthiri’ that literally translates into “wicks of love and care”. The concept of Snehatthiri is that they provide the raw material for free to not just the elderly but anyone and everyone who volunteers to make the wicks. The money made from this process goes for the welfare of the cancer patients.', 'The response from the initiative has been tremendous. Lakshmi cites:', 'Approximately 130 employees of RapidValue, an IT firm located at Infopark in Kochi volunteered and made 10,000 wicks (330 bunches) in an hour. Several groups of friends, neighbors and relatives joined in rolling the wicks. Several schools have expressed their interest to have their students participate in this activity.', 'Wicksdom is spreading its wings abroad as well. A group of well wishers are spreading the word in UAE where it is enjoying several buyers. A website, www.mamadeva.com, which is owned by NRIs in the US and that offers online pooja service at temples has expressed their willingness to promote the Grandma Wicks through their online forum. Kerala Hindus of North America (KHNA) association also has stood in support to promote Wicksdom in US. The brand and concept is simultaneously being popularized by Good Karma Foundation started by Lakshmi’s brother Vasudev Narayanan in US.', 'Presently, awareness about the Wicksdom initiative is being spread at religious gatherings, clubs, schools, etc. The Grandma Wicks team is actively trying to introduce the wicks in temples where these can be included in the list of pooja offerings. They soon plan to get a stable market in Kerala and replicate the Wicksdom model in neighboring states and ultimately make these available all across the country in a sustainable manner.', 'The Wicksdom journey has just begun. It is a journey consisting of small and simple, yet magnificent steps. The little steps can be seen as giant leaps towards happiness and satisfaction. As Lakshmi says it in Napolean Hill’s words, “If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.”', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
