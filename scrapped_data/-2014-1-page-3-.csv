It reports the highest incidents of violence and sexual assaults against women. In addition to that, it hosts a large population of refugees and immigrants from neighbouring countries, who flee persecution in their own nations and hope to build a better life here. Unfortunately, many times they become even easier targets for abuse. In this context, we present to you the laudable efforts of the Crime Against Women Cell of the Delhi Police for imparting self-defence training to refugee women.', 'It is a nondescript room on the ground floor of a run-down building in India’s capital city. The lane winds its way deep inside the depths of west Delhi. The majority of refugees from Myanmar live in this corner of the city.', '“Now, attack,” says a young policewoman. And the women, all refugees from Myanmar, get into position. A grab and a lunge from behind, hand on their partners’ throat and waist.', '“Defend!” A deft turn, kick and they break free from their attacker’s hold, pushing with force the hands that grip their throats.', 'They go through the drill with enthusiasm. This group of 30 refugee women are being trained by the Crime Against Women Cell of the Delhi Police and this is a part of a ten-day training programme organised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and its partner, the Socio-Legal Information Centre.', 'The issue of personal security is an important one for these women who have already gone through the trauma of displacement. “I want to protect myself,” says Ngun, a 50-year-old widow from Myanmar. “I have heard that Delhi is a dangerous place for women and that refugee women have been attacked.”', 'There is a suppressed anger among the women – a rage even – that is evident as they go through the training. Every move is hard fought – it is as if their frustrations are being played out through their actions and their unknown tormenters are being punished.', 'Delhi has the highest rate of crimes against women in India. Sexual harassment on public transport and random attacks in isolated parks are commonplace. And for many of the refugee women, it is a learning process to understand where the dangers lurk. Taking a short cut through a park after a long day’s work seems the most natural thing to do. In the villages they came from, this was not an unsafe option. But in Delhi, many of the molestations and attacks have happened in these badly-lit and isolated areas.', 'Another risky place is the weekly night market. Because vegetables are cheaper the later it gets, refugees often visit markets at closing time – sometimes as late as midnight or after. There have been many instances of harassment, even pitched fights, as refugee men take on local men who harass the women from their community.', 'Hnem, 54, is a feisty woman who lives alone in Delhi. For her, the self-defence classes have helped her gain in self-confidence. They have also brought her new friends – she has a sense of camaraderie with her classmates. Says Hnem with determination writ large on her face, “If someone touches me at the night market, I can fight back. I feel more confident now.”', 'The policewomen conducting the training are constables who are trained in self-defence techniques. They have conducted events like this in colleges and schools before but this is their first time with refugee women. There are challenges. Says instructor Sunitha, 26, “They want to learn and they are learning well. But language is a problem. It takes a while for them to understand.”', 'The classes are in Hindi and there is an interpreter, which means everything takes twice as long. Sunitha is confident of the final outcome. “I know they will be able to do it, and I feel happy to be able to help,” she adds. UNHCR places a lot of emphasis on refugees learning the local language – in this case, Hindi. Free classes in the language are offered to refugees and asylum seekers – children and adults – at various outreach centres in the city. Everyone is encouraged to learn. After all, without being able to communicate in the local language, even asking for help becomes difficult.', 'Many of the refugee women in Delhi are working hard on their Hindi, women like Khawm, 43, who lives with her daughter. Her husband was taken away by soldiers in Myanmar; she doesn’t know if he is alive or dead. Despite this trauma, she is trying to pick up the pieces of her life by adjusting to life in exile.', '“I was molested once,” she says softly, adding, “We face a lot of problems in Delhi. Now if this happens again, I will be able to defend myself.” She would have liked the training to have gone on for longer – ten days, she feels, is too short. “The trainers are experts. I want to become like them – strong and confident,” she smiles.', 'Police constable Sharada, 26, one of the trainers, points out that a ten-day session can work wonders. “After 10 days, the confidence of these women will increase a great deal,” she promises.', 'The Delhi Police training team has also gained from this experience. They feel they will now be able to handle better similar training sessions that are to be conducted with other refugee groups in the coming weeks.', 'For these refugee women, the training represents a turning point in their lives. Years after their flight from the dangers back home, they are now ready to stand and fight back.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Read about his brilliant organization in Lucknow, which is doing just that – using sports in empowering underprivileged youth and improving their life prospects, besides imparting life skills to them and reviving traditional sports on the brink of extinction!', 'Nelson Mandela, the legendary South African activist and politician, identified the transformative and unifying power of sports and used that power to build a nation which otherwise protests and diplomacy could not. ‘Sport has the power to change the world‘, Mandela said. These were indeed the exact thoughts of Akshai Abraham, the founder of ProjectKHEL.', 'Akshai Abraham is an MBA from the prestigious Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM), Bhopal. He has over 7 years of experience including 6 years in the social sector in the areas of research, program development, project management and organization building and also a year’s international experience as a cultural exchange intern in Austria.\xa0In 2001-2002, as he worked in Austria for about a year as an AIESEC trainee, his experience of living and working in a highly developed country motivated him to rethink his career plans from IT to the social sector. A keen sportsman and a committed non-profit professional, Akshai’s vision is to impact the lives of underprivileged children and youth of India through KHEL. Says he:', 'My school education had a lot of focus on sports and extra-curricular activities. Sports played a big role in shaping my character and help me deal with many problems and difficulties including the early demise of my father. Sports has stayed with me throughout my life. Though never a really competitive sportsman, I played all sports whenever there was a chance and it helped me make friends, relieve stress, connect with colleagues and peers in a unique manner. Thus while the idea of starting a sports related program for children had been lingering for years, the idea of implementing Project KHEL was probably planted sometime in 2009-10. In 2012, after having worked in the development sector for 6-7 years, I felt the time was right to start my own initiative and Project KHEL came into being.', 'An innovative way of building life skills is through sports. ProjectKHEL – Kids Holistic Education and Life-skills, is a customized programme that uses sports as a platform to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds to grow into responsible and contributing members of the society. KHEL is a synergistic mix of “Sports for Development” and “Life-skills Education” approaches. Sports require and teach discipline, confidence, team-work, patience, tolerance, etc. which are essential components of life skills. Sports also help prevent children from engaging in anti-social behaviour by navigating their energy into activities which are fun and productive.', 'KHEL partners with organizations working with orphans, street children, slum children, village children, children in shelters and children of migrant and domestic labour and engages these children in a bi-weekly interaction for at least a period of 4 months, in which the children are given numerous sessions. The sessions are based on experiential and activity-based learning models where the children are encouraged to discover and express the learning from the session, on their own, through a discussion at the end of each session. These sessions help children develop critical thinking and problem solving skills, build their sense of personal worth and agency, and teach them to interact with others constructively and effectively. In addition, special thematic sessions are also conducted on issues such as health, sanitation, substance abuse, personal hygiene, civic sense, and sexual abuse.', 'ProjectKHEL had conducted its first regular session in July, 2012, engaging with about 200 children from 3 partner organizations. Today, however, KHEL is working with 10 partner institutions and 2 slum locations independently, engaging with 660 children every week and having imparted life skills to 860 children around Lucknow. The programme has been greatly appreciated by all the partner organizations and there has been a positive feedback throughout, especially in terms of growth in class participation and academic interest of the children who are also ProjectKHEL beneficiaries. Quoting the founder of one of the Partner Organizations of KHEL:', 'The good children have become better and the quieter ones have opened up much more and are doing way better than before, ever since they have become a part of KHEL Programme.', 'Another major achievement of ProjectKHEL is the Global Peace Games which was hosted in Lucknow in 2012 and 2013. These games, conducted at grassroots level all over the world, is an annual event and a global initiative to foster peaceful relations between communities. The Global Peace Games for Children and Youth gave the children from different schools and backgrounds an opportunity to interact with each other in a non-competitive manner and to experience various sports and games. The Global Peace Games of 2013 had also marked the culmination of Cambridge University’s Rickshaw Sports Project’s maiden visit to Lucknow. Six Cambridge students had visited Lucknow for a two weeks duration to interact with, play, teach new skills and learn traditional Indian sports from the beneficiaries of the KHEL program.', 'In addition to the regular Life Skills Education, special thematic sessions are conducted on various issues including Child Sexual Abuse, Civic responsibility, Substance Abuse and Dengue Awareness. One of their most well received thematic topics has been on Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM). The MHM sessions were first held in July, 2013, where KHEL reached out to more than 80 adolescent girls from rural backgrounds, in Salone, Rae Bareilly. Since then a series of sessions on MHM have been conducted with over 155 beneficiaries. KHEL has also entered into a partnership with Ecofemme, a Pondicherry-based organization working towards providing reusable sanitary napkins to rural adolescent girls and women.', 'Apart from using sports as a platform for imparting Life Skills Education, ProjectKHEL also strives to bring back traditional Indian games. They have introduced Kho Kho, Pitthu and Rumaal Kabaddi (a KHEL version of Kabaddi, requires minimal physical contact and can be comfortably played in a mixed group). In the recent past, KHEL had organized the 19th SubJunior State Basketball tournament in Lucknow and a 10 day long Charity Football Night Tournament, from November 14. This happens to be Lucknow’s first 11-a-side football tournament played under lights.', 'Akshai Abraham, Kamzason Hangsing, Angana Prasad and Arnab Ozah are the leading team members of ProjectKHEL. Apart from that, KHEL also has a young and motivated team of interns, volunteers and part timers, who range from being national level sportspersons to social workers. In the past a whole lot of international interns and college students were also associated with ProjectKHEL, interested in the cause which ProjectKHEL was supporting.', 'Currently working with 650 children, KHEL wishes to expand its operations and aims to be associated with more than ten thousand underprivileged adolescents in the next 3 years. To meet such aims ProjectKHEL definitely requires large amounts as grants and funds in a very short span of time. Their major sources of financial support in the past were funds and donations made by family members and friends, two online crowd-funding campaigns, fundraising events (corporate sponsorships) and they have also received a grant from Mahindra ‘Spark The Rise’ programme.', 'However, there are a lot of difficulties that are faced in the management of ProjectKHEL. The biggest challenge is, to get people to believe in the concept of Sports for Child Development. Shared Ms Angana Prasad:', 'As the general notion is more like ‘kheloge kudoge banoge kharab, padhoge likhoge banoge nawab’, (if you play and frolick, you will lose out; if you study well you will be successful) the main challenge is to make people believe in our cause. The good part is that this belief remains on a superficial level and the more one is able to follow the programme closely and observe the children over the days, the impact becomes obvious. This belief has been very high in the minds of schools and parents of our beneficiaries and exists at the funding and sponsorship level too.', 'Other difficulties have been the lack of funds and donations which limits the team of ProjectKHEL from hiring experienced people and this also impacts their intentions of expanding their much appreciated work to a greater level.', 'In a very short span of just two years, the initiative has received great appreciation. The founder, Mr Akshai Abraham, has been felicitated with the Karamveer Chakra, a national medallion for proactive Volunteer action. His dream of changing the lives of young children and youth through sporting activities and fostering peace amongst various communities is definitely coming true. Successfully achieving its mission of empowering life skills to underprivileged children to carry out their day-to-day activities with ease, ProjectKHEL goes beyond sports to reach goals in health, education, gender equality, child protection, vocational training and life skills sector.', 'So, the next time whenever you are in and around Lucknow, be sure to visit ProjectKHEL and experience the amazing work that they are doing. And if you are willing to bring about a change in the lives of young underprivileged children, explore the innumerable volunteering opportunities that KHEL offers. Nonetheless, you can also support them by engaging with them on their facebook page and spreading awareness about their activities and programs so that more and more children would benefit from their initiatives in future.', 'You could know more about ProjectKHEL through their official website – www.projectkhel.com\xa0or on their Facebook page.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Don’t we all wish to help them during their crisis of depression? NGOs like AASRA do it. Featured today on The Better India platform, Johnson Thomas, the Director of AASRA talks on how his NGO works to prevent suicides.', 'Life is a war. Doctors fight disease. Lawyers fight injustice. Teachers fight ignorance. AASRA fights to prevent suicide – that’s the theme behind AASRA NGO.', 'Johnson Thomas, the director told us that Aasra is a crisis intervention centre for the distressed, depressed and suicidal. It’s basically an emotional support service providing emotional first-aid to those who are contemplating suicide or are on the verge or in the process of committing the act.', 'We started way back in 1998, fifteen years ago on 13th September. A year before that we found that there were a high number of suicides in Navi Mumbai among the student community. This was a very worrying development and a group of people came together to set up this service as succor for those experiencing extreme emotional pain because of their problems they are facing. The service was for everybody and not just for students. We started out as a 6-hour helpline from 3pm to 9pm daily and then expanded to two lines for 24×7 services. Our team consists of volunteers from all walks of life specially selected for their innate qualities and professionally trained to provide emotional support to the depressed and suicidal.', 'As Johnson elaborated further, Aasra gets callers from all walks of life , from all across India and the world.', 'Mostly students, newly employed young adults, unemployed youth, youngsters experiencing break-ups or loss, recently retired, ageing and alone and terminally ill patients seek help from them. Johnson also elaborated a little on why depression and suicidal tendencies are increasing these days.', 'The world is changing and changing fast. Especially in India where the entry of multi-nationals and globalisation has set new patterns of behaviour among the middle class! They are left with little time to pursue their interests or give time to family while their desire for wealth and riches and status has grown exponentially. So this increases the stress on the family which is ill-equipped to deal with the changing scenario. The supportive factor i.e the joint family system which kept our families psychologically supported, has crumbled in most parts of India. As a result when crisis strikes, there is no one to turn to. Very often, the spouse or near or dear one is the cause of the problem or involved in the problem hence can do little to alleviate the pain. This has increased the psychological fragility of the new generation leading to an increased incidence of depression and is therefore leading them to suicide as an option.', 'Johnson talked further about Aasra’s role in helping people with suicidal tendencies.', 'Along with a Helpline facility, Aasra does many other activities as well. It organizes awareness talks, conduct workshops on suicide awareness, coping skills, stress management etc, visits hospitals, terminally ill care-centres, arranges public events, associates with college fests and events, distributes book marks, writes for blogs, websites and social media connections, provides email service, responds to letters, conducts street plays and so one. We even have events to commemorate world suicide prevention day/week/month, mental health week/day as well as Suicide Survivors Day.', 'Now that is quite an extensive list and we are truly impressed with Aasra’s bouquet of services. Its ten years of consistent high quality service and commitment have made it stand out as a big and reliable lifeline for many people all across India. It is because of their outstanding efforts in the field of suicide prevention that in January 2006, AASRA was awarded the Maharashtra Ratna Gaurav Puraskar, (awarded to NGO’s, activists, personalities of repute) by the Shiv Sangram Pratisthan, devoted to pursuing, upholding and commending the ideals of Shivaji Maharaj.', 'NGOs like Aasra are doing a very noble job. Life is the biggest gift and we all must live it fully. Aasra’s team consists of volunteers who deserve a round of applause. These volunteers are professionally trained and supported by internal systems. They come from all walks of life and classes. All the volunteers of Aasra, most of them being students, teachers, housewives, retired folk, young employed etc; are doing a wonderful job.', 'Johnson told us that their focus in the future is to expand their services by increasing their intake of calls with the help of new technology, provide a toll free number and also provide day care facilities and have a half-way home for people who are mentally ill and need professional support.', 'We thank Johnson for sparing his valuable time to share Aasra’s vision with us.

And it gives us hope to see in the form of empowered women. Here we present to you a letter from one of our readers who experienced what a lot of women experience every day in India – sexual harassment from a stranger on the street – but did not take it quietly. Instead, she got him arrested! This is her letter to us, describing the daring feat in her own words.', 'Date 12 Nov 2013\nTime 10:15 am approx.\nPlace: Cuffe Parade, South Bombay, outside Maker Towers and near Santoor Restaurant', 'I had just finished teaching my morning yoga class at my client’s apartment in Maker Towers. I was waiting a few steps outside the gate of the building for my car, as I’d just spoken to my new driver and told him where I was. I intended to cross the road but as there were a few vehicles passing I stood waiting a few minutes with my yoga mat and my handbag. I had put on a big loose shirt over my yoga clothes precisely for this reason, that I may have to spend a few minutes in a public space such the street, where there are men all over the place who can and will intrude on a woman’s personal space given half a chance.', 'While I stood there waiting, I saw this guy, who looked like he was in his early twenties, walking towards me and very obviously looking at me in a lecherous manner all the while. I gave him a stern don’t-even-think-about-it glare as best as I could. He kept walking towards me with the same sleazy look on his face. He then stepped behind me and I moved away a few steps to prevent him from trying to touch me. At this point he made a loud kissing noise as he walked around me and started crossing the road, stepping on the divider. Naturally, that really angered me. I raised my voice at him asking him what he was upto, in hindi. The road was quite empty so he turned around and asked me what he had done. I told him he knew what he had done. He very nonchalantly said sorry and continued walking away.', 'As I had my phone in my hand, I began taking pictures, but I only managed to get 2 pictures which were both of him walking away, so his face wasn’t in the photo. I tried getting a few more pictures of him but he was walking away pretty fast. Just then the car arrived on the other side of the road. I quickly crossed the road and got into the car. I had kept an eye on him so I could see that he was a little ahead, and he was in really bright clothes so it helped me in spotting him. I right away instructed my driver to follow the guy in the red and blue clothes as I wanted to take his photo. We (my driver and me) got hold of him and started scolding him. I quickly took photos of his face while yelling at him. He started apologizing a lot at this point. My driver wanted to beat him up but I did not let him do that, as he is an old man and I did not want things getting out of hand, in case the guy happened to be armed with a knife or god-knows-what-else. I told him very firmly and confidently that the cops will thrash him instead so we need not get into a street fight. He kept on apologizing saying he wont make the same mistake again, but I told him that I’m definitely going to the cops and that they would definitely find him and thrash the daylights out of him. Then I left the place and headed home.', 'At home, I took a few printouts of the photos I had taken and took them to the Cuffe Parade police station at around 3.30 pm the same day. I narrated the incident to an old cop there who asked me what had happened. After listening to me and looking at the photos, he asked me if I had the guy’s name or address or number. This sounded really bizarre to me. How and why would I have that information? I told him that I did not have any info on him, and that the most I could do in that situation was get his picture, and that I could have hit the guy but I did not do that as I expected the cops to do that after my complaint to them. A little later, a younger cop showed up and asked me to narrate the incident to him, which I did. He then looked at the photos and said he has the guy’s name (Avinash), phone number and address in his records. He told me that this fellow had come to the police station the same morning around 11 am and told them his own version of what had transpired and that he (Avinash) had expected to see me there and had even waited for a while for me to show up! He had told the cops that he had been cursing another driver in Marathi, when I walked into the scene and mistook his words and intentions. This younger cop then went on to tell me that this fellow must really be innocent, as he would not have come to the police station on his own if he had been guilty.', 'I was quite taken aback that the cops were siding with the molester. I very firmly told the cop that I am not stupid, and that I had seen what I had seen and I had heard what I had heard, so I am really sure of what had happened. I also explained to him that I had very convincingly and sternly warned the guy that I would go to the cops and that the cops would thrash him. I tried to make them see that this was the reason the guy showed up at the police station – to pre-empt being caught and thrashed by the cops, and also because he expected me to right away rush to the cops, as that is what I had told him I would do.', 'Slowly it started to seem like the cop believed what I was telling them and take my accusation seriously. He called the guy and asked him to come to the police station. I sat waiting there and he arrived about an hour or so later, with his mother in tow. His mother started pestering me to ‘forgive’ him and forget about the whole thing. It was harassment again for me, with her going on about it and making me look like the bad person and her son the innocent victim. I called Ruben Mascarenhas, founder of an NGO called Zero Tolerance on Street Sexual Harassment, for his advice on what I should do. I had volunteered with this NGO in the past so I had his number and I knew he would direct me to the effective course of action. Ruben told me I should file the FIR under Sec. 509 and not leave the police station without a copy of the FIR.', 'I was at my wit’s end and I almost considered letting the guy off the hook with just a ‘warning’ as his family had been begging me endlessly and making me feel like the villain in the scenario, always bringing up the fact that they were poor and I am not, so I should let him go scot-free. But Ruben told me to ‘please invoke the law and to not show mercy’, and that resonated with me strongly. I resolved to get the FIR no matter what, even if his whole family harassed me and even if it took me until midnight to get it done. Soon the guy’s sister and two of his friends arrived too and all of them, including the guy, continued to pester and plead with me to forgive him, as he would lose his job as a driver if I filed the FIR against him, and that, they claimed, would ‘ruin his life’. I told them that he should have thought of that before misbehaving with me. And that this city belongs to women and girls as much as it belongs to males, and we women cannot walk in the streets for two minutes in peace and without being intruded upon or misbehaved with, even in broad daylight.', 'I started lecturing them about how he had broken a law here, which merits punishment accordingly, and the law does not recognize saying sorry 50 times as a reason to let the wrong-doer off the hook. I tried my best to make them realize the gravity of his offence, but in their mind, I was just making a mountain out of a molehill. The younger cop assured me, after I unequivocally and firmly asserted that I want the FIR made, that it would be done just after he finished some of the paperwork that he was doing on some other case. Finally, at 8 pm I was handed a copy of the FIR. I was assured by the cops that he would be arrested right away and that he would spend the night and the following day in the lockup. They told me he could be let out only after 24 hours on a bail of a few thousand rupees. I remembered Ruben mentioning to me that Sec 509 had been made non bailable by the efforts of their NGO, but when I asked the cops about it they said it was bailable and that a few months later the case would go to the court and then the judge may or may not hold him guilty. If held guilty, he will be in jail for 2 years, I was told. I was pretty drained by all the drama by now so I took the FIR copy and left the police station at around 8 pm.', 'I would like to point out that it isn’t always easy to get a clear photo of the wrong-doer as they slip away in the blink of an eye. Even with the proper photo, I don’t know if the cops would have been able to catch him, had he not shown up at the police station on his own after my threats of getting him thrashed by the cops. They kept siding with him for quite some time and I had to very strongly assert that I am not stupid/crazy/delusional, that I had seen and heard what I was saying I had seen and heard, and that they should not be believing his version of what had transpired. Regardless of what they thought, if a woman says she has been sexually harassed and says she wants to lodge an FIR, the FIR has to be made.', 'Also, at no point during the entire incident on the street did any passer-by intervene or ask me what was wrong. People kept walking by simply minding their own business.', 'While making the FIR, the cop asked me my address and this guy (Avinash) was right behind him, well within earshot, and he was also trying to peek into the FIR as if he wanted to know my address. So I went to police station in my area a few days later, with his photo, telling them that if they see him in the vicinity, they should promptly do the needful to keep him away from me.', 'I think that if it were not such a harrowing experience to file an FIR, and if the cops were sensitized to this issue, a lot more women would come forward to invoke the law and then the menace could be curbed to a much larger extent. In my view, right now, most women deal with this menace by not dealing with it, because: (a) the process of going to the cops and complaining is a long and draining process and (b) they fear retaliation, as the wrongdoer will be out of jail soon enough and can retaliate, as the fear of law is still nascent in this country, (c) most people are not aware of the law and that sexual harassment is a crime punishable by law, and (d) many people in India accept street sexual harassment as a part of life which cannot be helped, as if men simply cannot help themselves when they see a woman, and as if there is no personal responsibility that the man can be held to, while he routinely misbehaves with women. The longstanding patriarchy all around has a lot to do with this mindset.', 'Despite the harrowing hours at the police station, I am glad I took action and I felt very empowered after getting him arrested. I personally am beyond fed up of this menace and it is simply unacceptable that we cannot take a walk in peace even in the day. I think it is high time women reclaimed their power and got militant about this, after all, it is a war against women if you look around. We have been taking this trash for too long, in the fear that we will have to deal with more trash if we fight back against it, but we have to realize that it is simply unacceptable in any extent.', 'Every woman in India is, and has to be, her own superhero every single day, simply to ensure her own safety. Fighting back is the only way forward, or else our streets will forever be minefields for us, and our cities will never be ours to move about in freely.

Here’s how.', 'One of the issues most Indian cities face is garbage management – be it the lack of adequate garbage bins where you would expect to find them or timely clearing from garbage collection points. Delhi is no exception, though being the capital city it gets a lot more attention on such matters – thanks to active citizens and a watchful media. While the city may not have garbage bins strategically located at major street intersections, it does have plenty of them in the more prominent public parks such as Lodi Gardens.', 'A few months back, Yogesh Saini, who grew up in Delhi and has recently returned as a resident, was on his morning jog in Lodi gardens and noticed the city officials replacing older garbage bins with new ones. It seemed to make little difference to many park visitors, who either stubbornly refused to use them or chucked their waste around or near the bins – just not in them. Often, at the end of the day, park staff could be seen collecting strewn items and stuffing them into the bins. Saini wondered if the garbage cans were just not catching the eye of those who were meant to use them – despite being newer and cleaner. If so, what purpose was really being served by this exercise?', 'While mulling over this question Saini, an entrepreneur, avid photographer and keen observer, decided to do something other than the usual ritual of exasperated complaining of how money was being wasted etc.', 'Lodi Gardens is like a giant oxygen tank of Delhi and blessed with all kind of natural beauty. These garbage bins stood out as sore thumbs – on one hand, not particularly visually appealing and on the other, failing to attract the utilitarian attention they were designed to seek. This is where morphing them into objects of art came as a thought and this led to the creation of Delhi Street Art!', 'One of the early lessons of being an entrepreneur is to be able to visualize what your idea is going to result in and be able to convince customers, investors etc. to buy into your vision. It took Saini just a couple of hours to create digitally clad images of these bins with random art images. Finding the right people to sell the idea to required a little more effort starting with the NDMC (New Delhi Municipal Council) website, followed by several phone calls and finally leading to in-person meetings with city officials. Just armed with “before” and “after” images of bins, Saini managed to convince NDMC leaders how this idea will work. Surprisingly he received an immediate positive response despite words of caution about the prominent location of the park and the fact that politicians and other high profile visitors can be the worst critics of anything they deem unfit for the green space.', '“Street Art Saturdays” started out as a series of events conceptualized and meticulously executed by Delhi Street Art (www.facebook.com/delhistart) in partnership with New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC). Since the launch in September, four such events have been organized on September 14, September 21, November 16th and December 14th, 2013 and have involved nearly 75 artists.', 'The primary goals of the Lodi Gardens events have been to add more color to Delhi’s open spaces, give local artists a creative outlet to express themselves, and to encourage the citizens to keep their public spaces clean, while appreciating the art.', '“Once all the garbage bins of Lodi Gardens have been painted in myriad styles and hues, it will become one of the most unique public parks in the world where over 100 individual art works have been conceived, created and displayed within the confines of the park itself. While there are several parks that house sculpture gardens and art galleries, we hope to turn Lodi Gardens itself into a huge public art gallery and studio!” says Saini who is an engineer and an MBA with a strong creative streak and interest in the public domain. He observes:', 'You will not usually come across people strumming a guitar inside a Delhi Metro station or practicing the latest breakdancing moves around India Gate. People are generally wary of the authorities and over the years have been conditioned to maintain some ‘decorum’ and stay within acceptable guidelines in public places. But, all that is starting to change – from appearance of a smattering of wall murals to impromptu street theater performances. Delhi will see more of such expressions in the coming years as it’s in the process of cultural liberation.', 'O. P. Mishra, Director, Projects, at NDMC is an enthusiastic supporter and a vocal proponent of Delhi Street Art’s efforts. It was he who ensured that Saini got all approvals for his project within days and turned both the chairman of NDMC, Mr. Jalaj Srivastava, as well as the former Delhi Chief Minister, Shiela Dixit, into fans of the effort. “We have bigger dreams. We may now look at walls, subways, school compounds. The idea is to involve the citizens of Delhi so that they feel a sense of ownership about the public spaces of the city and take pride in living in the capital” says Mishra', 'Artists are given a certificate and memento jointly by Delhi Street Art and NDMC for the time and effort they spend on transforming trash bins into the vision of their creativity.', 'Nishat Rehman, an accomplished Delhi photographer and artist who has held several shows, was one of the first to join Delhi Street Art and brought with her a long list of achievements and a large following of friends and art lovers. She is an active participant in all Lodi events as well as one of the key members of the organizing team. Maria K. originally from Russia, calls Delhi her home and in between learning Kathak and classical music, enjoys applying Russian folk art style blended with Madhubani strokes to her public art. She too joined Delhi Street Art back in August and has been an active participant in all events.', 'In addition to the events at Lodi Gardens, Delhi Street Art has also been involved in organizing street art workshops and other projects including an “Art on the Rooftop” event in November.', 'Following the very positive response to the events in the past couple of months, Saini is looking at possible larger format art initiatives in other public spaces of Delhi as well as other Indian cities. Says Saini:', 'We hope this is just a small beginning and have several ideas we would like to explore in the coming months. It was really important to get initial validation before we stepped out to do more. Artists are reaching out as are art lovers and we will continue to do our best to bring more color and creativity to public spaces.', 'We at The Better India thank the Delhi Street Art team for bringing a spattering of Art to our public places, and hope for many more such efforts in all Indian cities, towns and villages!\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

But instead of grieving about them, she chose to draw lessons from these and reach out to others with a similar or worse plight. Preethi Srinivasan is a quadriplegic but that’s not what defines her. She chalks out and realizes plans to help other people with severe disabilities to stand on their own feet with dignity through her organization, Soulfree.', 'Preethi Srinivasan was the captain of the under-19 Tamil Nadu women’s cricket team. She was a champ swimmer. Even after the unfortunate accident that left her quadriplegic, she continues to have all the virtues of a champion sportsperson. Today, she champions the cause of others in need. Post the accident that has left her paralysed below the neck, her life is harder but has found a new meaning that she enthusiastically embraces. Yes, the championship streak of this sportsperson continues.', 'Her accident altered her course of life. Physically, mentally and emotionally. An easier choice might have been to succumb to life’s and society’s unfairness, sit back home and lament the twist of fate. But what emerged eventually out of all the struggles was a new messiah and leader for people. Physically, she might be confined to a wheel chair but she weaves plans of freedom for others like her through her organization Soulfree. Soulfree is a Tamil Nadu based small, public charitable trust that Preethi has started to provide women with severe disabilities with hope and assist them in fulfilling their highest human potential by providing a basic quality of life.', 'Could you expect a girl in India to be so much into cricket right from the age of 4 years? You might, if you are talking about Preethi Srinivasan. The most devoted fan of the legendary West Indies cricketer, Sir Isaac Vivian Alexander Richards, Preethi was the youngest at just 8 years old to play for the Tamil Nadu Women’s Cricket Team. Her passion for the game even made her attend a cricket camp that had been organized for 300 boys. And no, she didn’t shy away from the boys; on the contrary the boys were apprehensive of bowling to such a hard hitting ‘batswoman’! She also captained the U-19 TN Cricket team to its only victory in 1997. That aside, she was also a champion swimmer. She stood first in the state in the 50m breaststroke and came second in all the other swimming events. The sport helped her develop strong shoulder muscles.', 'And then came the ill-fated incident on 11th July, 1998 that could possibly shock any body’s imagination. Preethi was 18 at that time. She had had a wonderful college trip to Pondicherry and was returning to Chennai, when they stopped by to spend some time at a private beach owned by a classmate’s father. Soon, they went to the shores and with the other girls, she started to jump on the waves in thigh deep water while the boys swam and played in the deeper portions. Preethi narrates those horror-filled moments that followed:', 'A receding wave churned up the sand from under my feet, tripping me up. I stumbled a bit and dived face forward into the water. Having been a swimmer since the age of three, you would think I would have an instinctive knowledge of how to fall into water. However, as fate would have it, the moment my face went underwater I felt a shock like sensation travel through my body. That’s it – no impact (I did not hit any rock or the ocean floor, or anything hard at all), not a drop of blood, just a split-second of misfortune. I didn’t feel pain or lose consciousness, and there was absolutely nothing dramatic. As soon as I felt the shock travel through my body, I couldn’t move. I tried to get back out of the water, and nothing happened, so I held my breath until my friends pulled me out.', 'Pandemonium and fear struck everyone. Yet, it was Preethi who kept her cool and even as she felt faint, she got others to conduct her own first aid, following which she was taken to the JIPMER Hospital in Pondicherry in an ambulance. There she was made to wear a spondylitis collar, without proper diagnosis and sent to Chennai for a thorough check up after labeling it as a case of “accident”. It took four crucial hours to reach Chennai for proper treatment, where she was diagnosed not with spondylitis but a severe case of paralysis. Preethi still wonders if those four hours of misdiagnosed medical care would have made all the difference in her condition today. Now, improvement in emergency medical care is one of the topmost priorities of her organization Soulfree. Says she:', 'Anyone who has been in a road accident in India understands that the emergency medical care system we have is extremely poor. Many a time spinal-cord injuries occur after an accident, when the victim is being removed from the vehicle, taken to the hospital or soon afterwards. It is vital that trained emergency medical technicians who are aware of how to stabilise the spine so that spinal-cord injuries can be prevented are available soon after an accident. In Western countries all one has to do in case of an emergency is to make one phone call – to bring exceptionally well-trained personnel who know exactly how to stabilise and deal with the given problem in a professional and skilled fashion.', 'For an athlete and a young person, dealing with such a life-changing accident can be a calamity, and requires super-human strength to carry on. Preethi recalls the difficult time:', 'For the first 18 years of my life I had effortlessly excelled in every area of my life, and the future seemed to be brimming with infinite potential. Then, in a split-second, it was all over and I found myself having to come to terms with life in a wheelchair. At 18, one identifies oneself completely with the material plane – appearance, achievements, status amongst peers, et cetera. I thought I deserved all the success I got purely because I worked hard with integrity and sincerity. Then, I reached a stage where I could not even move my little finger no matter how hard I tried. What could I have done to deserve such a fate? I was shattered. My identity was completely lost and I felt invisible to the world. Who was I? I didn’t know, I didn’t want to know – I wanted to die.', 'A disability is not just a mere robbing of the physical vital functions of body parts, although that is painful enough, but for most it also brings with it the loss of a sense of dignity and self-worth, and a feeling of becoming secluded from the world, as Preethi described. For Soulfree, hence an important agenda is to build or retain the self-esteem in the victims of severe disability by helping them identify their own strengths and latent talents and earn a living and command respect, not mere sympathy from others.', 'If Preethi intends to be the sturdy support of the severely disabled in need, it is Preethi’s parents who have in turn, been her backbone. In fact, it was Preethi’s mother who had convinced her to start such an organization. Preethi reminisces:', 'After my father’s death, my mom also became very sick and needed to have a quintuple bypass surgery in 2011. I guess she also had the stress and worry of what would happen to me if she was not around to care for me. So, in her usual generous way, she started to think that this must be a concern all parents of the disabled would have, and because there was no solution in India, she encouraged me to start an NGO and begin working towards providing sanctuary for many more like me. I became more exposed to the plight of the disabled, especially women in India – I was really disturbed. I began hearing of cases in which women were encouraged by their own families to commit suicide. When I found out that so many are being treated as a burden by their own families, not given rehabilitation or even a basic quality of life, and so severely stigmatised that they feel there is shame in staying alive, I could not sit quietly anymore. If those of us, who are reasonably secure, decide to ignore the cries of those in need, then our society will never evolve. People like Helen Keller became an inspiration for me, and I thought, if they had a place to go, if they were given hope and a reason to live; if they could live with dignity, a basic quality of life and become productive members of the society, they wouldn’t be forced to commit suicide. This has to happen, and if it must happen through me, then so be it. This is how Soulfree was born.', 'A community support system can be that much-needed backbone that could help them bounce back to life. In this respect, Preethi is proud of her parents. Says Preethi,', 'The greatest blessings in my life are my parents who’ve always showered me with unconditional love and support. After the accident their generosity of spirit and greatness was even more evident as they quietly sacrificed their lives so that I could live with dignity. Never once did they blame me for destroying not only my own life, but theirs as well and all their hopes and dreams for my future. I’m alive today because they stood by me and cared for me every moment of every day. My mother is my Goddess.', 'However, not everyone is as blessed in this respect. Many families feel burdened by the responsibility of a severely disabled member. And if such a person is a woman, and that too from an economically weaker section, then it spells a bigger trouble. Soulfree aims to tackle this key issue by having certain rehabilitative measures like providing a home for quadriplegics and paraplegics who wish to live independently or are unable to get adequate support from immediate family, and making available skilled and qualified doctors, physiotherapists and attendants on call, and also have a caregiver training institute. In addition, they hope to provide skills training to facilitate productive employment.', 'Today, her wheelchair restricts her movement. There was a time when she was an avid traveler. Her father had a transferable job and the result was that she had visited 9 different schools in 3 different continents. Recalls Preethi:', 'It’s extremely difficult to always be “the new girl” and each time I would settle into a milieu and start making friends, it would be time to go. At the time, the constant adjustment was painful, but now I realise the tremendous value it provided me in terms of exposure to various cultures, traditions and types of people. Perhaps, it has also given me a deep intuition about people and how to make them feel comfortable and confident about themselves.', 'It was probably her born intuition about people, her keen interest on the workings of the human mind, human relationships and perhaps her natural talent to be a Secret Keeper where people would comfortably divulge personal and confidential thoughts with her that made her want to study psychology. But that wasn’t meant to be for the girl who in grade 12, had made it to the Who’s Who List of America for being among the country’s top two percent merituous students!', 'In 2001 my father approached various universities (in Tamil Nadu) to join a bachelors in psychology. However, the rule book was thrown at us saying that I would have to come and spend 15 days at the University for compulsory contact classes, and that the buildings at the University are not wheelchair accessible at all. At one point my father got vexed and said that there was no need for some paper certifying that I’m intelligent or knowledgeable. He brought me books I could read and expand my horizons with, and so I continued the learning process, even though I couldn’t have a degree.', 'It seemed as if her excelling experience in swimming and cricket was being tested severely. She had to swim against the societal tide of rejection, pity and even being associated with misfortune. Her shoulders might have given way, but her sturdy will power and family support made her hold on to the bat and hit all the curve balls and off spins that fate was mercilessly bowling out at her in the battlefield of life. She took a pause and once again started hitting out to the boundaries. She describes,', 'Not being able to control even the most basic functions of one’s body, being totally dependent on others for one’s most private needs, the complete and total decimation of all of one’s hopes and dreams for the future are things no one can get over easily. It took me a long time, and I still have hope that a miracle is possible in any moment… I do wish I could be healthy again, I do wish I don’t have to be dependent on any one ever again, and if it happens, it would make me blissfully happy. At the same time, there is an existence beyond the physical plane, and somehow, my limitation has opened that realm up to me. It is magnificent in its own way, but impossible to explain or express in words. I believe that a human life is most meaningful when it brings about growth and evolution in the body mind organism. In that way, I’m exceptionally blessed because I have evolved more in these 16 years than I could have in 16 “normal” lifetimes – innumerable struggles and two near death experiences have given me that much.', 'There were dreams that were abandoned and hobbies that had to be given up but that gave way for new ones. Among her many interests, she wishes that she could have pursued cooking and photography. However, she has still kept alive her interest in music, art, films and literature. She enjoys reading, watching films.', 'I also started working doing synopsis, editing and reviews for some friends, as well as spiritual magazines like Tattvalokha, which allowed me to gain a great deal of knowledge about spiritual texts. After doing web-content writing work for a few years, I’m presently working for a movie-based website called www.moviebuff.in as a synopsis writer. A few years after the accident, I also started doing mouth paintings and designing of posters, business starter kits, et cetera. When I embarked upon my journey with Soulfree, this experience came very handy, because I was able to design the logo for Soulfree myself – and that gave me a lot of joy and satisfaction.', 'She also recently completed her Bachelors in Medical Sociology (thankfully this did not have any compulsory classes to be attended on campus) and is in the process of enrolling for Masters.', 'Preethi has given several inspiring talks of motivation at various institutions. In fact, she hopes to use her voice to the fullest for this cause. She explains,', 'Through my words and example, I feel that I can be a source of inspiration for many, and motivate them to look beyond just the material realm, into something more meaningful and worthwhile. I honestly believe that I’ve been chosen as an instrument by the cosmic flow to spread light, love and laughter in the world, and the greater positive impact I can have in this world, the more fulfilled I feel.', 'Through her organization, Preethi hopes to create a massive change in the Indian society for the severely disabled by spreading awareness about spinal cord injuries and their prevention, better treatment, enabling greater educational and employment opportunities, creating an exclusive toll free helpline in Tamil Nadu to reach out to those in dire need in connection with spinal cord injuries, organizing networking events for them and changing the perception of the wheelchair-bound in India. With the help of the entertainment industry and corporates, Soulfree aims to create gainful employment for those who can only use their voices. This initiative, called “Throat Fort” aims to train quadriplegics in the use of their voice for various vocations like recording of audio books, radio jockeys, voice dubbing artists, telephone marketing, etc.', 'The NGO that is still in its infancy is one of its kind in India and has the potential to bring about monumental change, an inclusive society and create a revolution for those suffering from severe physical disabilities. However, to realise this dream of Preethi’s and her parents’, the support of one and all is required. Youth and voluntary organisations like Rotary, Vaergal and Nal Vidhaigal in Tamil Nadu have already come forward in support of this initiative.\xa0In Preethi’s words,', 'Grace has run my life and continues to guide me through everything. I have full faith that the citizens of India will respond to the sheer merit of the Soulfree cause. Already, many people are coming out in support and wish to volunteer their time, expertise and resources for Soulfree. I have no doubts that, as and when more and more people come to know, the movement will gain momentum and begin creating a positive impact in the lives of many.\xa0I do not wish to go around asking for donations. My idea is to go to schools, colleges and corporate houses to give inspirational talks and use the funds collected from them for Soulfree’s activities. There is so much to do in terms of building databases of the disabled, volunteer databases, and setting up programs to increase awareness et cetera that we are going to need a lot of help from volunteers, and the media.', 'We do wish Preethi and the Soulfree initiative great success in achieving their goals and encourage all our readers to free their souls and do their bit for a more inclusive India.

While submitting her thesis on analysis of anti-trafficking NGOs, called “Victimhood Discourses and India’s Anti-Trafficking NGOs”, she ended up discovering the direction of her life. Meet Robin Chaurasiya – who has spearheaded Kranti, an NGO, to focus on helping trafficked girls escape the sex trade, heal, achieve a good education, and be self-supporting.', 'The fact that Robin Chaurasiya’s parents immigrated to Indore and she grew up in Seattle in the United States did not lessen her love for India and Indians. The lady is a staunch feminist and assumed the role and responsibilities of an activist for social change at a very young age. After completing her MA in Gender Studies at the Central European University in Budapest, Robin Chaurasiya started volunteering in Mumbai and founded Kranti, an NGO that aims to empower girls from Mumbai’s red-light areas to become agents of social change. She was equally supported by Trina Talukdar, another passionate social entrepreneur.', '\nRobin Chaurasiya (left side in the pic) joins us today to share her views and vision.', 'I’ve always been frustrated by society’s “writing off” of marginalized people – sex workers, queer people, differently-abled people, etc. It’s not that they lack the ability to building amazing lives and communities; it’s that society purposefully restricts and prevents them from doing so. I have spent much of my life traveling the world and volunteering in different NGOs, but the place that struck me the most was my time at the Rescue Foundation in Mumbai.', 'Robin narrated a 5-year old incident that happened while she spent 5 months volunteering with teenage girls who had been “rescued” from brothels.', 'These girls were kept in the NGO for anywhere from 5 months to 5 years, following a ‘rescue, rehabilitate, repatriate’ model – after being taken from brothels, they spent time at the NGO, learned unsustainable skills (achar/papad making, tailoring, etc.) and then were either sent home to a situation where nothing had changed, or married off if they had no family. There was no formal education, no therapy, no true healing. The staff there always told the girls, “tumhari zindagi barbad ho gayi.” But they’re 15, 16, 17…I felt that their lives were just beginning! What if someone wanted to become an astronaut? A painter? A writer?? But even more than the girls’ desire to grow, heal and work, I found they had an incredibly strong desire to “fix” society, or at least the things that had caused them to end up where they were. So the idea of Kranti was born – a place where girls learn, heal, grow – but also learn about social justice and how to be leaders in their communities.', 'We must tell our our readers that prior to founding Kranti, Robin was an officer in the US military and a well-known activist who raised her voice for queer rights in the army.', 'What is different about Kranti is the fact that it does not regard Red light area or sex workers with disrespect or a skeptical attitude. Kranti believes that red light areas are like any other workplace and hold the potential to be healthy, empowered communities and rights-based work places if we give them enough support. Kranti believes that sex work is a job or profession like any other and should be legalized and supported with benefits.', 'And Kranti has done its part by being just the right support for many girls. Sometime back, Shweta Katti, an 18-year-old girl was in the news as she succeeded in fighting the social stigma of growing up in Mumbai’s oldest red light district, Kamathipura, and earn a scholarship from a university in the United States for her studies.', 'This Mumbai resident – Shweta Katti – on National television confessed how NGO Kranti helped in empowering her. Says Chaurasiya:', 'Kranti’s core belief is that girls from red-light areas, if provided with the same education, training and opportunities as middle/upper income children, will not only be “as good” leaders, but that they will be far better leaders – more compassionate, more innovative and more resilient because of their backgrounds. Shweta is proof of this belief – she’s traveled several countries alone, taught girls who are at-risk for being trafficked, worked for Adivasi women’s rights, spoken at 50 conferences to audiences of 5K+, and shared her experience of child sexual abuse with thousands of kids across India. I do not know any “normal” kids from middle/upper classes who could accomplish these things. It feels wonderful to know that so many people around the world are inspired from her story and also that her life will go a long way in changing people’s mindsets about red-light areas.', 'Indeed, Kranti has emerged as an NGO working for women’s rights by providing a healing home, comprehensive education and personalized opportunities to empower and equip India’s trafficked girls, sex workers, and otherwise socially disadvantaged young women. It also aims to provide these women and daughters of sex-workers with the knowledge, skills and confidence necessary to build fulfilling futures.', 'We are still in the process of perfecting our model. We’ve basically created an equation for empowerment, but each girl has different variables. For some girls, it’s dance, for some it’s karate, for others it’s drawing. So we are currently working on expanding those variables. In the long run, we want to create our own home which will include living space, a coffee shop/bookstore selling the girls artwork, space for theater/film screenings and other community events, and a regular schedule of activities for marginalized girls from various communities. We struggle a lot with our current housing situation, where girls are called ‘randi’ (prostitute) on the streets, our building watchmen tell people they are ‘rescued girls’, etc.', 'Robin also shared that Kranti team dreams of having their own school some day for marginalized girls which will offer all of the education, training and opportunities that Kranti’s girls currently have.', 'When all of these girls start traveling the world and become amazing leaders/social change agents, we want the world to realize that marginalization does not have to be a burden – it can be an asset.', 'What an inspirational vision that is! Women like Robin Chaurasiya stand out as perfect examples of Women of Substance and we applaud her role as a social activist. Hoping to see many more Kranti girls hitting the headlines for all the right reasons! Way to go, Kranti!', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Cow dung contains nitrogen – that is also common knowledge for farmers. Then why is it that many farmers look for costly solutions rather than use the abundant cow dung they have in their farms as manure? Luckily, one farmer did think of this.', 'Four years ago, with a little documentation help from the MYRADA Krishi Vigyan Kendra in Gobichettipalayam, Erode district (Tamil Nadu), India’s farming fraternity recognized farmer G. R. Sakthivel’s efforts in successfully using cattle refuse to create liquid manure to feed his crops. This feat is by no means ordinary and did not happen overnight. A staunch advocate of the organic movement, Sakthivel had always wanted to utilise resources around him efficiently and he wasn’t going to leave out cattle refuse, which was there aplenty in all farms.', 'After years of careful observation and planning, he came up with a plan to recycle cow dung and urine from his farm. He designed a 4-compartment unit for this purpose. First, the floor of the cattle shed was sloped to direct the urine into a channel. This urine drained into a collection tank. Next the dung was removed manually from the floor. The collected dung-urine mixture was allowed to settle and filter stage by stage inside a compartment. The process resulted in a nutrient-rich filtrate. He diluted this filtrate and used it to directly irrigate his sugarcane fields using drip lines. The dung residue was not wasted either. It was directed into the bio-gas producing facility, which converted the waste into methane gas to fuel the family kitchen.', 'Though this set up drew the attention of several farmers across the country, not many embraced it as it was expensive; the 4-tank collection and settling masonry structure cost a minimum of Rs. 40,000 including materials and labour. Farmers with small holdings couldn’t justify this expense, as much as the end result seemed worthwhile.', 'Alagesan, a farmer in Myladi in Chennimalai decided to experiment with Sakthivel’s model. He wanted to create a simpler and more cost effective liquid manure plant so that more farmers could benefit from the readily available manure on their own farms.', 'He did away with the dung collection and settling tanks since that was the major expense. Instead, he came up with a single container manure factory. No cement structures, no labour charges, no building costs. All he used was a huge plastic barrel.', 'Cow dung and urine is dumped in it together and allowed to settle for 24 hours. For every kilo of cow dung, 5 litres of cow urine is added. A little jaggery is then added to this mixture to help ferment it and voila! At a fraction of the cost, the same liquid manure is ready! This entire set up costs just Rs. 800 – 1000. Watch the video below as Alagesan explains how one can set up an organic manure factory on one’s own and how it works. (If you cannot watch the video here, please click on this Youtube link.)', 'The barrel set up has two advantages. The first and most obvious is the affordability. The second and equally important advantage is portability. Unlike the immovable masonry structure, the barrel can be moved according to the farmer’s requirement to any part of the field. Maintenance is much simpler as well as cleaning doesn’t take much time or effort.', 'Both these men are still working towards simplifying the process further so that these manure churners can be placed in as many farms as possible. While many farmers in and around Erode have set up these manure factories, it will still be some time before these portable manure factories become as common as a plough or a sickle, which is found in every farm.', 'Many thanks to Mr. P. Alagesan, Programme Co-ordinator, and the staff of MYRADA Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Gobichettipalayam, Erode district for their help and support.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
