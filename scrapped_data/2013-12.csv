1,2013-12,"['Archives', 'Samaritan Help Mission: Creating Opportunities Where None Exist!']","['\n\n\nby\n\nPalak Bhatia\n\n\nDecember 30, 2013, 2:13 pm \n\n\n', 'Mamoon Akhtar is a man on a mission. The Samaritan Help Mission. Through this remarkable organization, he is changing the outlook for an entire area in West Bengal, bringing education, health, livelihoods and development to all the children, especially girls, living in the slums. Read how one man can open up a world of opportunities for people bereft of them until then.\xa0', 'City-dwellers have enjoyed the benefits of good education, healthcare and employment opportunities since many years. These are things that we have come to take for granted, things that are readily available to us. However, there are still a very large number of remote areas in India that continue to be isolated from such facilities and live in a relatively poor environment. In the absence of such basic necessities, the people of these areas have changed very little in their lifestyles and means of livelihood. They continue to struggle for survival in the dearth of requisite skills and education that can lead them towards bettering their situation. Samaritan Help Mission is a noteworthy organization striving to provide adequate facilities to the poor population of the Tikiapara region in West Bengal.', 'Samaritan Help Mission is an organization that aims at providing developmental opportunities to the poor and needy slum children, with a special emphasis on young girls. These are designed in a way so as to give them quality education and impart life skill education, so that their hidden talents and capacities are explored and developed. It is most essential to train the children for a secured livelihood so as to lead a productive and fruitful life with self-esteem and self-dignity and to rise above the narrow consideration of caste, creed, community, religion or language to build a strong nation.', 'It was the passionate appeal of a child wanting to go to school in the year 1991 that prompted the founder of this project Mamoon Akhtar to start teaching 5-6 children in his own house in the Tikiapara slum. As the residents of the area became aware of this ‘school’, more and more children started coming and there was no place to seat them. Mamoon constructed a room on his own small plot of land (600 sq.ft.) and the one room Samaritan Help Mission School was born with 25 young eager children flocking to it. Mamoon rose to the occasion and went from door to door to raise Rs.28, 000 p.a. (in addition to his own contribution of Rs. 10,000). The organization has continued to steadily grow through the years.', 'Started in May 2007, the Samaritan Mission School is an English medium school for poor children of all communities. Under the umbrella of Illiteracy Elimination project, it is especially aimed at girls who are deprived of the basic right of education. The parents of the children are very poor because of which, they cannot get access to modern education. The children range from various underprivileged backgrounds like rickshaw pullers, daily labourers, etc. With Samaritan Help Mission’s efforts, their dreams have turned into reality. The school was run from pre-nursery to class 6 till 2009, and since then, every year has witnessed its expansion with one more class.', 'Along with this, Samaritan Help Mission has also introduced many varied ventures to further improve the lifestyles of the poor by giving them opportunities that are not currently available to them. These programs allow them more liberty to become independent and self-sufficient, giving them a true chance at establishing an identity for themselves.', 'Samaritan Help Mission also sustains a Computer Literacy Program, wherein computer fundamentals are taught to students in a small computer lab containing six computers. In less than four years, the venture has been able to make 675 poor girls computer- literate.', 'Vocational Training Program for Women is aimed at unmarried and illiterate girls from poor backgrounds, who do not have any means to survive and earn their livelihood. Under this project, they are trained in Hand embroidery and provided work avenues to make their living. The training project has about 200 women. 50 girls are regulars working in the manufacturing unit, with each girl earning between Rs.2500 and 3000 per month. These women are working regularly from 10 am to 5pm in the unit and are now very confident and financially & educationally empowered.', 'Samaritan Micro-Credit Program was introduced in October 2008 and has so far provided 124 women with loans between Rs.1000 to 5000 to start their own small businesses. The focus has been on the vocational trainees who, after undergoing the necessary training to acquire the requisite skills, need a loan to start their own business. The program is proud of having zero defaults and has changed the economical condition of these women who earlier had to borrow at usurious rates as high as 10% per month from the local loan shark.', 'Because of the fact that health care for women and children in Tikiapara had become quite urgent, Samaritan Health Care & Awareness Centre was inaugurated in June 2009. The centre treats around 80 patients daily. The focus of the health centre is mainly to spread awareness about health issues, start a cleanliness drive in the locality and also teach about family planning. A regular motivation campaign is also organized among the poor women who abort female foetuses, teaching them that our past, present and future are all dependent on young girls.', 'It can be seen that the organization is working very hard to fulfil the needs of the people, especially young girls, and give them new avenues to make their life better. They need our support to continually grow and function in a satisfactory fashion.

2,2013-12,"['Written by Gangadharan Menon', 'An Indian Circus: We Took A Look Behind The Scenes And Were Amazed With What We Saw!']","['\n\n\nby\n\nGangadharan Menon\n\n\nDecember 26, 2013, 1:23 pm \n\n\n', 'The children have holidays and what better place to go for a bout of innocent entertainment than the Circus? Well, at least that used to be the case for most of us growing up, when the circus came to town! And many of us retain fond memories of those days. Here Gangadharan Menon relives those memories by visiting the renowned Kohinoor Circus not just to watch a show but to meet the colourful characters and talented performers behind the scenes.', 'Circus has changed dramatically. During my childhood (and that was a very long time ago), a circus was a grand spectacle that paraded a plethora of wild animals tamed by the whip of the Ringmaster: tigers, lions, seals and hippopotamus. I still remember the palpitations of my tiny heart as the lion opened its mouth wide and the ringmaster in a valiant gesture stuck his head into the lion’s gaping mouth. But to my teenaged wonder, the lion did not snap its mouth shut.', 'Thankfully, the ban on making wild animals perform has brought down their long list to just elephants. On the reasoning that elephants are tamed to perform menial tasks and in temple festivals, they continue to be found in circuses. In Kohinoor Circus they were found playing cricket and even performing an elaborate pooja of Lord Shiva.', 'Probably the ban on animals was a blessing in disguise. Because, the focus of the circus then inevitably shifted to the exhibition of incredible human feats, created with imagination and executed with supreme skill.', 'The circus continues to fascinate me. Inside that imposing tent there still exists a heady mix of magic, music, dance, jugglery, acting and showmanship. They roll out in clockwork precision, relentlessly for a breathtaking 150 minutes.', 'Of all the circus feats that I had witnessed in my childhood, a few vestiges still remain in today’s circus: the well of death where a motorcyclist rides a bike in vertical circles; the drunken clown who performs immaculate feats on a galloping horse; the cycle that breaks into innumerable pieces when the clown mounts it; and the fire-eater who performs with amazing dexterity. And even today, people continue to applaud the same feats with the same child-like exuberance and innocent joy. Proving that despite the overt changes that have happened around us, human beings haven’t changed at heart. We still laugh at the same things, cry at the same things, and of course worry about the same things.', 'My rekindled curiosity took me to meet Raja Hussain, the young manager of Kohinoor Circus, now tented on the outskirts of Navi Mumbai.', 'He told me how difficult it has become for a circus to survive. Three decades ago, there were over 900 circus troupes in the country. Today, there are less than a 100 left. Just like the animals that once used to grace these circuses, the circus too has become an endangered species.', 'As I was speaking to Raja, I realized the sheer logistical nightmare of running a circus. In a single troupe, there are over 250 people living in the tents that dot the periphery of the Performing Tent. This includes artistes, carpenters, masons, electricians, tailors, cooks, managers and innumerable helping hands. A mini township of sorts. Apart from managing their inter-personal relationships, their daily needs like food, water and basic amenities have to be taken care of. And since the circus is a 365-day affair, there is not even a break to set things right, in case something goes wrong. The circus equipment itself is so humongous that it takes over 30 massive trucks to transport them to the next location.', 'There are over 25 families staying in this joint-family of Kohinoor. Many of them are husband-and-wife duos. With both the parents being performers, the children pick up the ropes of circus from their infancy. Nay, from the time they are in their mothers’ wombs.', 'The owner Amjad is a true patriarch who dotes on his family members, taking care of their every little need. To entertain these master entertainers, he has even installed a direct-to-tent television connection!', 'There were two gigantic goats moving around the circus tent, who I mistook as circus performers gone astray. But Raja had an interesting story to tell. Those two goats were bought by Amjad to be sacrificed on the day of Bakri Id. But during the entire week that these animals spent with him, Amjad had become so attached to them that he refused to sacrifice them on the appointed day. Now they go wherever the circus goes, as a constant reminder of Amjad’s compassion.', 'With Raja’s help, I met Pinki Khan, the multi-faceted star of the troupe. She in fact personified all that this amazing performing art stands for. She was charming and had tremendous presence; she had the svelte figure of an athlete; and she was a consummate performer. In short, she was the quintessential circus girl.', 'Pinki grew up watching her parents perform; and today, she has taken over the mantle from them. She is equally adept at handling a slew of African parrots, or executing fabulous stunts on the bicycle, or performing the most breathtaking feat of them all: the flying trapeze. Her brother too is part of the troupe; he plays the keyboards in the circus band. Her husband has also been a part of the troupe for over seven years, and is today an accomplished trapeze artiste and an ace shooter. In short, they could easily be called the First Family of Kohinoor.', 'Pinki gets up 5 in the morning every day and practices for five hours, just to be perfect. Because she believes that in a circus, you only get one chance. There is no retake.', 'Even today, after performing for more than a decade, she confessed that she has an irrational fear running through her veins as she waits 100 feet above the ground, waiting for the most awaited event of the show to begin: the trapeze. And every time, her father, who’s now the master trainer, encourages her to take that all-important leap into the unknown.', 'Then I met Sagar Singh, a man who has been a clown for over 50 years. He’s 70 now and still performs. Born in Purulia in West Bengal, he ran away from home when he was 12 to join the circus. The first job he got was to distribute pamphlets. Then he became an announcer going around on a cycle, announcing the arrival of the circus. He was then taken as an extra in a minor item called the Rope Dance. He then graduated to become a motorcycle artiste, then a trapeze artiste, and then a trainer. But when there was a vacancy for a clown, he decided to take up that role permanently as that was what he loved the most. Make people laugh.', 'Once it so happened that, just as he was in the midst of a show, he got a telegram. Since he was illiterate, he couldn’t figure out what it said. He asked the manager to read it out to him. Just as he was informed that his son had died in a bus accident, the bell rang announcing his entry on the stage. In a daze he entered the ring, and made people laugh with his antics, profusely crying under the thick make-up of a circus clown. After the show, he trudged back to the green room, accompanied by a deafening applause, and then he fainted. This story travelled far and wide. So much so that Raj Kapoor, the film-maker, came to meet him to hear this story. And inspired by it, he made the famous film, ‘Mera Naam Joker’. To this day, Sagar Singh is peeved at the fact that there was no mention of him, or his son, even at the end of the long list of credits that came rolling down at the end of the film.', 'As I watched the finale of the circus, I saw Pinki’s middle-aged mother perform on the swinging trapeze with consummate ease. And her father, the master trainer, kept an eagle eye on the proceedings to detect even a tiny flaw that could later prove fatal. And then came the climactic act of the flying trapeze. Perched high above mere mortals was Pinki, the lone girl among five other trapeze artistes.', 'My heart skipped a beat as she went flying on the trapeze, left it in mid air, and went gliding into the waiting hands of her partner.', 'That act for me symbolized the dying art of the circus. Here was a troupe of 250 hardworking and dedicated people, who, to keep the oldest performing art of India alive, have left the trapeze in mid air. With the fond hope that their outstretched hands will fondly and firmly be held by a discerning audience. Lest they fall into the bottomless pit of oblivion.', 'P.S. Just as the ink was drying on this page, I read a newspaper report about the artistes from Rambo Circus having performed in the renowned Prithvi Theatre of Mumbai on World Circus Day. This indoor show could well be the sign of things to come. And innovation may be the last hope for this performing art, which has been slowly dying in this country in the last three decades. But I hope both versions continue to exist: the one in gigantic, magical tents and the one in small, discerning theatres.', 'Gangadharan Menon is a nature writer, art teacher, and photographer of the wild.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Over the last few years, Sikkim is being promoted as one of the top tourist destinations in the country owing to its culture, breathtaking scenery and biodiversity. The state promotes eco-tourism in an effort to help local communities and protect its beautiful environment. Sikkim’s homestay program is also supported by UNESCO.

It is a five hour drive from Bagdogra to Gangtok. A good part of the first day saw us shuttling between airports and spending time on the road from Bagdogra to Gangtok, but the excitement of reaching our destination overcame the fatigue of travel. We reached Gangtok late in the evening and settled for the night at Mintokling guest house, a cozy spot in the heart of Gangtok.', 'Tsogmo Lake, Nathula Pass, Baba Mandir \nIt is a 54 km drive from Gangtok to Nathula Pass.

Once upon a time Mr Rabiualh was just another labourer in one of the GCC countries working for a measly sum but as he says “…he was not ready to accept misery as his destiny.” Today this man is the proud owner and managing director of Shifa Al Jazeera Group; a leading private health care provider in the Middle East, which runs several optical shops, pharmacies, clinics, and hospitals around the GCC and in India. The Saudi based billionaire, apart from other projects, also plans to establish world-class multi-million riyal hospitals in Saudi Arabia which he says will employ around 300 young Saudi medical professionals and technicians.', 'In the same land lives Dr Majid Uddin Kazi who originally hails from Hyderabad. Now a retired 74 year old, Dr Kazi has served as a personal physician to the crown prince as well as king Fahd of Saudi Arabia and was also appointed as the cabinet minister. In 2006, Mr Kazi was conferred with the prestigious Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award by the then President of India APJ Abdul Kalam. This gem of a person owes his success to his wife and does not wish to be seen as a role model. He says:', 'I am no role model, so please don’t copy me. I am less than a dust particle floating in space. By chance, the rays of the sun illuminated it for a while.', 'What would you call a man who began with a small road side shop and then went on to being ranked by Forbes as the ‘Richest Non-Resident Keralite’? The story of P.N.C Menon, now an Omani citizen, is truly fascinating. Decades ago, this current 65-year old left for Oman with just Rs 50 in his pocket after being invited by an Omani friend whom he had met ‘accidently’ in a hotel in Kerala. He says:', 'Till then I had never heard of a country called Oman. A few weeks later I landed in Muscat with Rs. 50 to start a new life.', 'As he did not compromise with the quality of his work, he along with his business partner soon started gaining confidence of his customers and as he says, “we started getting businesses in interiors and fit-outs”. His turning point was when he was asked to work on a palace of the Sultan of Oman and then worked for the ruling families of Bahrain and Qatar and president of Tajikistan. Later by 1995, Mr Menon founded Sobha Developers Limited, a construction and real estate development business to expand his business in India, which today is a reputed real estate developer brand in India and has its presence in both Oman and Dubai.', 'Hasan Chougule of Qatar is indeed an all-rounder. He travelled to Doha in 1978 and after a brief stint in Mannai Group established his very own company called Emad Electricals. Mr Chougle is also a dedicated social activist and educationist. Along with 5 others, Mr Chougle started DPS – Modern Indian School and is also one of the founder members of Ideal Indian School. Apart from being the Managing Director of Emad Group of Companies, he also serves as the vice-chairman of the Doha Grand Hotel Group. Mr Chouglule indeed wears many hats. He is the only Indian to head the three cultural forums namely ICC, ICBF, and IBPN, which is directly backed by the Indian Embassy. Last year, Hasan Chougule was awarded the prestigious Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award for his contributions to the region.', 'Few months ago The Economics Times published an article which said that about half the wealth of all the 55 Indian billionaires combined is much above the country’s fiscal deficit. Micky Jagtiani is one of these billionaires. This founder of the Landmark group, a Dubai based company, started with just one store in Bahrain. The Landmark group, one of the largest retail conglomerates in the region, mainly sells children’s clothes, footwear and cosmetics. It has also established various International stores like New Look, Kurt Geiger, Shoemart and Steve Madden. And has come up with their own brands like Splash, Maxx Fashion, the Baby Shop and the Home Centre. Today, Mr Jagtinai’s wealth stands at $4.5 billion. What’s more fascinating than these achievements is that Mr Jagtiani was a school dropout and a cab driver in London before leaving for Bahrain.', 'These are just few of the fascinating tales. Be it the fashionable Sara Belhasa of the Belhasa Group or Yusuffali MA famous for the Lulu Chain of Hypermarkets. Be it Ramesh Prabhakar of the Rivoli group or Sunny Varkey known for GEMS Education. These Indians chose their battles wisely and emerged victorious.', 'But they are not just successful entrepreneurs. Dr K.T Rabiullah has taken under his wing an entire village which he belongs to and has launched a scheme there through which he grants monetary assistance to the poor and needy. He also donated generously to relief efforts of Tsunami, Latur and Gujrat earthquake. Ravi Pillai has built Upsana Hospital and Research Centre in Kerala. Sunny Varkey’s GEMS Foundation is chaired by US ex-president Bill Clinton. Their philanthropic side only makes them more appealing and inspiring.', 'These Indians did not inherit the life they are living today. They ventured and they gained; did not succumb to fate; and wrote their destiny in golden letters. They are extraordinaire in the choices they made and the risks they took.

And from now on, we intend to do just that – hunt for exceptional stories related to sports and sports personalities and put them up for our readers! Today, our sports correspondent Manish Kalra profiles the incredible life of Badminton superstar Pullela Gopichand, who has endured several hardships in his career but emerged strong through them all due to his remarkable dedication and sense of values, to win medals at several prestigious championships including the Olympics in his capacity as athlete and coach.', 'It happened a bit too fast. Saina Nehwal had just started imposing herself in the bronze medal match by engaging her opponent in long rallies. Before you could completely sense it, her opponent had to pull out due to a knee injury.', 'It is perhaps ironical as well as fitting that India’s first badminton medal in Olympics was won because an Indian player turned out to be fitter than her counterpart from China.', 'In that moment Saina’s coach, known for being a hard task master especially when it came to physical fitness, shed tears of joy. Saina had just fulfilled the incomplete dreams of her coach by winning an Olympic Medal.', 'This coach of the Indian badminton team, Pullela Gopi Chand could easily be mistaken for a gentle, soft spoken and dignified Hyderabadi software engineer. During a felicitation ceremony for Saina, a well-meaning Indian Sports Minister had once inquired about the credentials of the gentleman who had accompanied her. As is typical of Gopi Chand, he went ahead and ensured Olympic and World Medals for India leading to many more felicitation ceremonies.', 'Not just Sports Ministers but sporting history will now remember him for posterity.', 'But let us start at the beginning to tell the story of a man whose sports career is an example of rare fortitude and commitment.', 'Playful childhood with limited shuttlecocks but unlimited ambition', 'Pullela Gopichand was born in a family that had modest means but placed a premium on values and discipline. Like a lot of kids, all his waking hours were spent either playing or thinking about exceling at his chosen sport, badminton.', 'But what stood out even at that early age of 11 was his passion to win and his ability to work extremely hard at his craft.', 'The strict discipline and regular sleeping habits at home ensured that Gopi was the first to hit the practise courts at 5:30 AM. This was a half hour earlier than his team mates, ensuring he got some more court time. Likewise when practice would get over, his eagerness to excel would lead to him to ask for and then do more physical exercises.', 'In his developing years, Gopi would struggle to have enough shuttlecocks to play and often he would have to control or curtail hitting his favourite jump smash.', 'Gopi’s mother would walk for miles and avoid public transport to save money that was used to buy her son a shuttle cock. As Gopi started his climb to the top echelons of the Indian badminton scene, his family smilingly endured a lot of hard ship and sacrifice.', 'The biography of Gopichand touchingly depicts how the simple family chose to forego movies and restaurants and even all social and family outings for over a decade. This was done to save enough money for the travel, kit and shuttlecocks that their son would need at an increasing rate as Gopi’s game and his smashing took on a more effective and aggressive form.', 'During those days there was a practise of permitting Indian sports persons to represent the nation but “at no cost” to Government. This meant that his family would have to sell their jewellery to fund his travel and stay while he played for the country.', 'During these International tournaments, Gopi would play fearlessly and attack uninhibitedly even against top ranked players. Yet Gopi would also plan for future conquests after the matches were over. This planning would include collecting used shuttlecocks during the tournament, and he would return home with a huge set of used shuttlecocks, much to the amazement of Custom officials.', 'Fate brought Gopi to his knees, but hard work and belief made him fulfil his destiny', 'As Gopi was on the threshold of dominating the national badminton scene, he suffered a severe knee injury in 1994. While playing a doubles match, his doubles partner collided with him and landed heavily on Gopi’s knee. In an attempt to continue playing so that his team did not default the match, Gopi further injured himself.', 'Gopi spent a difficult and testing year recovering from a complex knee surgery that required over 30 stitches. He was backed throughout this difficult treatment by a knee surgeon, Dr Ashok Rajgopal.', 'Dr Rajgopal overheard Gopi’s mother talking about the financial constraints in paying the operation fees. This good doctor then refused to take money and asked for his payment to be the All England badminton title for the country.', 'Gopi spent months without walking but not without practising as he would continue to do wall practise even from a stationary position. He also picked up a reading habit and devoted time on yoga to further improve his concentration.', 'With extreme determination and unflinching faith, Gopi doggedly continued his rehabilitation for over a year and was eventually able to return to his past form.', 'By 1995 Gopi was not only representing India again in the All England Badminton championship but he also went on to beat the current Olympic champion Alan Budikusuma. It is a different matter that his family had to still borrow money to enable him to make the trip. Further he had to walk for over an hour after that victory to reach a modest bed and breakfast hotel that was selected purely to save money.', 'By the turn of the century, Gopi had established himself as a multiple national champion and had brought laurels to the country in team events like Thomas Cup and the Commonwealth Games. And it is a testament to the values of his family, that Gopi often donated his prize money for winning the nationals, initially for Gujarat Earthquake relief and then for the Kargil martyrs fund.', 'Gopi continued to hone his craft and practised with monastic discipline for the Olympics in 2000. However players from the other countries were already wary of Gopi and he would rarely get to practise with top international players. His Olympic dreams were shattered in 2000 when he lost to the eventual silver medallist. Perhaps the cement court and the lack of practise partners affected his chances but yet again Gopi would come back stronger.', 'In spite of the setback in the Olympics, Gopi established himself as a world beater by 2001 with victories over all the top 10 players in the world as well as a ranking in the top ten.', 'And in 2001, it all came together beautifully for Gopi as he went on to win the All England Badminton Championship without losing a single game. Gopi had finally paid the doctor his dues.', 'Gopi’s biography depicts a fascinating passage of play during the 2001 championships where Gopi’s match play temperament and analysis of the game came to the fore to help him win the semi-final.', 'The book has Gopi depicting how he out thought the top seed Peter Gade during the final points of his match by placing his serves and strokes where the opponent least expected them. This was a defining moment where Gopi the player and Gopi the future coach came together as one.', 'And it would be as a Coach that Gopichand would fulfil his next set of dreams.', 'By the very nature of their craft and their constant dedication to themselves it is extremely tough for any star athlete to become a good coach. It is here that Gopichand has transcended his brief.', 'Due to his exploits on the court, Gopi was awarded land by the Andhra government to build a badminton academy. By mortgaging his family property and with help from an industrialist, Nimmagada Prasad, Gopi somehow put together the required funds to build a state of the art sports academy.', 'As was typical of his career, the academy was built brick by brick with complete support from his family with his father often spending the entire night at the construction site.', 'But brick and mortar and a glowing career alone do not automatically lead to coaching success.', 'The success of Gopi as a Coach was seeded by 3 unique aspects that came together:\n1. His own path breaking efforts to improve fitness levels and change the ways of Indian badminton. During the 80’s, Indian badminton players were known for their stroke play and stylish wrist work. Conventional coaching in India also emphasized constructing a point rather than overpowering your opponents. However to counter the immense speed, strength and stamina of top international players, Gopi developed his own aggressive and energetic playing style and training regimen. If this meant that he had to move out of the top national badminton academy, Gopi had the courage and conviction to take the path less travelled.', 'Gopi then sought out his own coach (Ganguly Prasad) and training facility at SAI Bangalore. He experimented with differing training routines as well as meditation and visualization techniques with increasingly better results. He also embarked on a gruelling and physically strenuous training regimen, eventually leading to a top five ranking in the world.', 'It was this ability to take personal responsibility that Gopi has instilled in his trainees. As a coach, Gopi has stressed on physical fitness and demanded complete dedication from his trainees. This focus has eventually moulded a supremely fit generation of players.', 'Gopi’s wards have benefited from years of his own experiments in training methods. As a coach, Gopi had the requisite varied experience to ensure his wards got the right guidance. Gopi was able to tune his coaching techniques to suit the natural strengths of his wards.', '2. The relevance of being a recent champion and an active coach. His early retirement at the age of 30 in 2003, meant that Gopi was still fresh enough mentally and agile enough physically to put his heart and soul into coaching.', 'As Gopi could relate to the game as well as the generation that he was coaching, he was able to help his trainees prepare for match play. Gopi’s inputs during the match would often help Indian players turn the tide. And in this way there was a coach who had not only won recently at the highest level but was also ready to practise and hone the skills of his wards from dawn till dusk.', '3. The coach who could “Walk the Talk”. Finally Gopi is the right Role Model for a generation that looks for actions to speak rather than words. Gopi’s passion to win for India aligned to his dedication for badminton, were a perfect template for hard working youngsters like Saina and Sindhu.', 'But a coach has to walk the talk at all times for his students to throw their lot alongside him. This ability to set a personal example is illustrated by one final anecdote:', 'After the all England Championship and the ensuing popular acclaim, Gopi was offered a lucrative contract with a soft drink major. He declined the contract as he felt that this would send the wrong message. Gopi reasoned that an impressionable audience would start opting for the soft drink in the belief that it is a health food based on its endorsement by a sports star.', 'It is this ability to live and lead life by such principled ideas that have provided Gopi Chand with the moral compass to push and yet inspire youngsters to achieve their potential.', 'The achievements of Gopichand speak for themselves. An Olympic medal in badminton, 2 medals in the world Championships, 2 women players in the World Top 10 and 7 Indians in all in the World Top 30 in singles.', 'Ultimately in his own distinctive way, Pullela Gopichand is building a better India, every morning, starting sharp at 4:30 AM.', 'For being the human being he is , I cannot find a better role model than Gopi for my child.

Let us now provide support to her and her organization by participating in a carnival they are having for the children this Sunday!', '25 years ago, Mrs. Teresa Lily Samuel took up the cause of leprosy eradication in rural Bangalore, in collaboration with Franciscan Service Society. Her role was pivotal, in eradicating leprosy and providing a respectable living for all those cured of leprosy. The taboo and misbeliefs attached to lepers made her job tougher, but she stood tall and strong, till she had treated everyone and sent them back with dignity to their homes.', 'One activity led to another and Sandeep Seva Nilayam was born as a means to empower women. Rural women were often illiterate and lacked support and were forced to live a life of abuse and oppression. Mrs. Samuel took it upon her to rescue these women and provide them comfort and confidence to get back into the mainstream. She started women’s self-help groups that would give them financial independence. Mrs. Samuel nurtured talent among distressed women and over a period of time, she transformed small time vendors into business women. There are about 20,000 women who have benefitted through Womens’ Empowerment schemes in and around Nelamangala', 'Sandeep Seva Nilayam was officially established in 1993, with the sole intent of uplifting the poor in rural Nelamangala, a small town on the outskirts of Bangalore. Over time, Sandeep Seva Nilayam became the go-to support for women empowerment, health education, child rights movements, attempt to abolish child labor, education and rehabilitation of child laborers, supporting the disabled and a bureau for missing children. Also, it is active in running campaigns for Tuberculosis, HIV and other village development activities.', 'Started as a humble journey by Teresa Lily Samuel and Samuel Prabhakaran, SSN as it is popularly known has grown and spread its wings to shelter many a cause. People that have benefited – adults and children alike fondly remember the love and care they received from this couple. SSN has had its share of tough times. Lack of support and funding could never dampen the spirits of Mr and Mrs. Samuel. ‘What we do is just a drop in the ocean!’ is what Amma (Mrs. Lily Samuel) says with a smile on her face and a twinkle in her eyes.', 'SSN now runs a ‘back to school’ program, where children are given basic education and scaled up; so they could go back to school (according to their age). Children who are school drop outs – laborers, abandoned kids or children coming from very poor background. The work done here is intense. Starting from simple grooming skills, providing kids with clean food and clothes and inducting them into a classroom atmosphere takes at least a year. Post this, the children go through basic Math, English and other coaching, so they can be on par with children their age. SSN has a team of dedicated faculty that performs its duties, under the able guidance of Mrs. Samuel. SSN, has supported over 600 children in the last 5-6 years.', 'One thing anyone would notice at SSN, is that the children are very well mannered, well dressed and most importantly ‘happy’.', 'Sandeep Seva Nilayam has won several accolades for its commendable work in all field of human welfare. Noteworthy of them being the ‘Kittur Rani Chennamma Award’ conferred on Mrs. Lily Samuel in 2012, the Highest Civilian Award in the State for Women Achievers. Though the institution has done path breaking work over the last 25 years, they have always chosen to remain quiet about their activities. An attempt to spread awareness about children and bringing together like-minded individuals in a single sphere, is the next step for SSN', 'Revive 2013 is the first of its kind carnival organized by friends and well-wishers of SSN to create a fun atmosphere where children can connect with the outside world in a friendly manner. Through Revive they do not intend to propagate the tough backgrounds of the children and gather sympathy. Instead they want people to visit the children and have a fun time with them. Games, food, music etc. will be an avenue for children at SSN to bond with other children, parents, students, grandparents etc. An attempt to instill a sense of acceptance, and making them ‘our children’ is the motto behind revive 2013. As a next step, they are inaugurating a virtual classroom, where children can learn online. They want people to participate by teaching the children or even by uploading relevant content towards the virtual classroom. The benefits of bringing technology to enable people to grow and thrive are immense.', 'They will have collection areas in the vicinity where people can drop off old clothes, books, shoes, sports equipment, e-waste, CD’s, dry ration etc. Food stalls will be open throughout, women’s self-help groups will sell articles and other curios, some stalls will feature popular games. They plan to revive some rustic games like spinning the top and cycle-tyre race etc.', 'The idea is to spend a fun-filled day with children that are less fortunate and give them a sense of acceptance and well-being. The Carnival is also a platform to recognize the relentless efforts put in by Mr. and Mrs. Samuel and their strong support team that manages all the daily activities, without a hitch. Revive 2013 is a confluence of people from different backgrounds that are keen to help children and other humanitarian causes.

Started in 1997 with just 36 students, the school which was built with donations from a lot of kind-hearted people now accommodates 272 children.', 'Lack of good educational facilities in remote areas compels parents to trek from distant places to enrol their wards in this school.

The young and vibrant Rahul joins us today to talk about what actually made him spearhead ‘Teach A Child’ Foundation, an NGO committed to providing quality education to children from urban slums.', 'Rahul Gupta is a young entrepreneur from Chandigarh who has grown up in an affluent family believing in the ethics pounded in by his family.', 'He always felt that when motives are good, any situation ends up favouring you somehow. So whether it was his idea to initiate a school or plans of creating a 100-acre forest to offset the emissions with our real-estate work; he feels a spiritual kind of support while driving motivation to action.', 'Rahul founded ‘Teach A Child’ Foundation to create a stronger foundation of education for slum children. He tells more about this:', 'The purpose of Teach A Child is to strengthen the base of the weakest kids from low-income backgrounds so that they can excel in higher education. All our kids are selected through a common test conducted, and the failed students are hence selected for the program since they require the maximum assistance. Our program focuses majorly on primary school children since most of them have not attended preschool classes like Kindergarten and hence it’s difficult for them to cope in classes, resulting in them droping-out. We enable kids to go through their ‘kindergarten till 3rd standard’ through a 2 year special support school program in which major focus is on English, Maths and Computers.”', 'Interestingly, Rahul had a thriving real estate job that required him to travel all across India and that’s how he got a chance to see the ‘real India’. The discovery shocked him and at the same time inspired him to take a step for education.', 'When I was a child, I had to change schools very frequently due to my father’s job. So having studied at over 8 schools throughout, I realized how the quality of education imparted in schools is very different from each other. Further research exposed me to the fact that there are at least 57% of children who do not complete primary education and how education is the most important medium to spread awareness on different social issues, and this was enough for me to take a step towards TEACH A CHILD.', 'Rahul and his team understands the importance of parents in a child’s education and hence they have made it a point to communicate with them about their rights under the ‘Right to Education Act’ (RTE).', 'Teach A Child team is currently working on taking the very same to a new level by creating a series of videos on RTE, which further could be used by non-profits all across the country to spread awareness about the rights of a child as per the RTE.', 'As such, we spread our ideas by holding events, through media channels, social media, youth interactions and through our brand new Teach A Child t-shirts also. We even conduct events in malls such as Teach A Child At Elante Mall in Chandigarh wherein we set up a mock classroom with benches, blackboards and our kids for the visitors at the mall to experience teaching and join the movement.', 'Rahul told us that Teach A Child is a number driven organization and hence everything is measured.', 'Their first batch of 50 kids have shown magnificent improvement and have been growing with a steady pace. Hundred percent of their students have shown positive growth and have shown an average growth of 27% in a span of nine months. He feels so proud of those three girls who also topped their classes in their schools. Regarding financial support, Rahul shared:', 'We partner with companies for their corporate social responsibility programs and we also have few donation boxes at different outlets in the city that help us sustain. We also hold fundraisers and events to raise funds to expand the organization. Teach A Child is an absolute youth effort – our team, our board of advisors and corporate partners, all are young. Our managing director, Manveen Sarna and our program manager Sid, an IT guy – both of them are quite young and enthusiastic about the whole thing. Our funding partners and board has young people like Mr Anil Advani, a well seasoned lawyer from the Silicon Valley having a strong belief in Teach A Child.', 'Now, that indeed is a great effort and we are happy to spread a word about Teach A Child. Campaigns like this which focus to partner with the government in the future to place well-trained, worthy teachers to teach at the government schools in order to maximize the impact, deserve a round of applause.

10,2013-12,"['Archives', 'Young Kashmiri girl makes an app to bring Kashmir on the fingertips']","['Today we profile the efforts of 23 year old Mehvish Mushtaq, a young Kashmiri entrepreneur who is using the power of technology to bring about a change in Kashmir. In fact, Mehvish is the first Kashmiri woman to develop an android application.', 'One of the realities of Kashmir today is the movement of thousands of Kashmiri youth to other parts of the country in order to seek better career opportunities for themselves, especially in the field of information technology. One young woman, Mehvish Mushtaq, 23, is determined to buck this trend. Instead, the one ambition she nurses is to create opportunities for young people at home, so that they could win laurels for themselves and for Kashmir. ', 'But who is Mehvish? She happens to be the first Kashmiri woman to develop an android application that goes by the name ‘Dial Kashmir’. A Srinagar girl, Mehvish did not receive an education in a fancy elite college or university. After completing her schooling from Presentation Convent School, she sat for the All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE) examination. Disappointment followed. Having failing to clear the AIEEE, Mehvish joined the SSM College of Engineering and Technology at Pattan, in Baramulla district of north Kashmir.', '“I was always interested in technology and fortunately my family supported me in my decision to go into this field. In fact, no one in the family has ever forced me to do anything,” says Mehvish, whose father has served as officer with the Indian Foreign Service. Her mother is a homemaker while her brother is pursuing his education in Delhi.', 'Mehvish completed her three-year Bachelor’s course in 2012 and was wondering on what to do next when life took an unexpected turn. She puts it this way, “I was generally going through my Facebook profile, when an advertisement popped out and caught my attention. It seemed interesting so I clicked on it.” ', 'That was how Mehvish joined an online course for developing applications. Always a person who wanted to get deeper into subjects that interested her, she found herself immersed in the world of application development. “The course itself was not long – it was completed in one month. But during that course, we were given a project to develop an application,” Mehvish explains.', 'The idea of ‘Dial Kashmir’ struck her at that juncture. Kashmir had no yellow pages or dedicated websites with reliable information unlike other regions of India. This meant that people faced a lot of problems trying to track down contact numbers of different departments and services. Mehvish, knowing well that there were many users of android mobile phones in the Valley, felt that if she came up with the right app she could be addressing an urgent need.', 'After two weeks of hard work, without any assistance or help, ‘Dial Kashmir’ became a reality for Mehvish. It provides users detailed information such as addresses, phone numbers and email ids of various essential services and relevant government departments in Kashmir. It is a one-stop source for information on healthcare, education, transport, the police and so many other sectors and meant that no one now needs to spend time and tedious effort surfing through internet pages, official websites and directories. Her application has witnessed an average rating of 4.7 out of 5, with a thousand plus downloads on Google Play.', 'It disturbs Mehvish to note the absence of proper educational and career opportunities for infotech aspirants, which in turn forces thousands of young people to leave home every year. “The absence of relevant colleges and universities is a big issue in Kashmir. Our youth are not able to develop their potential here,” she says.', 'Mehvish has experienced for herself the innumerable hurdles that prevent Kashmir’s dynamic young innovators from realising their potential. But she would like them not to lose hope and keep dreaming big. Mehvish’s particular dream is to set up her own software company – which could provide employment opportunities for many and contribute to the world of infotech. Says she, “There is no point in just complaining that there are no opportunities. While that is certainly the case, I believe we have to find ways to create opportunities – not just wait endlessly for the government to act. It’s time we stood up and got noticed.”', 'Mehvish is working to add more contacts to the application and upgrade it further. She is also contemplating on developing a dictionary for the Kashmiri language. Says the young woman firmly, “I want to contribute to my motherland by staying right here.
