FreMo, India’s first bicycle sharing programme is a step in that direction.', 'FreMo derived from ‘Freedom To Move’ gives the commuter freedom to move from one place to another, without depending on the public transport or using their own car/ bike. Various FreMo depots have been established in Thane . All one has to do is register with them, take a cycle from one of these depots and deposit it in the depot nearest to his/her destination.', 'They have various membership plans, depending on the usage. Every FreMo member is entitled to a personal accident assurance of Rs. 5 lakh.', 'Here’s an interview with V. Ramesh , Founder CEO & Director of FreMo.', 'After visiting Barcelona in early 2008, when I came to India, there was a huge petrol price hike.\xa0 And I saw many people trying to cut down their expenditure on petrol as much as possible.\xa0 This prompted me to think that making the use of bicycles convenient would make people accept the idea of cycling for daily activities.\xa0 Once a person signs up with us, he need not depend on autos or buses and has the freedom to move.\xa0 Thus, FreMo (short form for Freedom to Move) was born.', 'Q :Tell us about the\xa0 hurdles you came across while setting up the venture?', 'The hurdles started with people being surprised that I am moving out of a comfortable job as a CEO in a NBFC (Non-banking finance company) to become a “cyclewalla” and telling me not to do it.', 'Then came the struggle to get people to accept this as a workable idea.\xa0 Getting funds was the worst experience of my life.\xa0 All so called ‘venture’ capitalists never wanted to venture in to this social concept.\xa0 They were only interested in two things (a) How much will I make out of this investment (b) what is the exit route for me.\xa0 This gave me a confirmation that all those guys are only “investors” and not ‘venture capitalists’.\xa0 Even the requirement of a small amount of Rs. 2 crores did not find donors. Then I started looking to banks to support this project.\xa0 All of them, except one were unresponsive.\xa0Finally, Bank of Baroda supported this project.', 'Then there was a struggle to try and meet up with the government authorities like TMC whose support is vital for the success of this programme.\xa0 I drew a blank in their response.', 'Finally, the struggle was to get staff.\xa0 Many of them did not feel that this was a business they wanted to be associated with.\xa0 Most of them wanted to work in a call centre or IT or other such businesses which are well known.', 'FreMo has been designed to work in conjunction with other modes of transport, to get around the problem of transporting bikes on buses and autos etc.', 'Various depots are established at strategic locations across the city. Register yourself with FreMo and take a membership. With your membership card just pick up a cycle from any depot convenient to you. Just cycle to your station / bus stop / shopping / or any short trip. Return the cycle to any depot of your choice; the one you hired from or at a depot close to your destination.', 'Both customers and potential customers have excellent words to say about this project. \xa0All of them feel that we need this project in the current context since the environmental situation is getting from bad to worse.\xa0 Besides, the traffic issues are so many that people traveling short distances are fed up with them.\xa0 They are also victims of high unpredictability on their travel time.\xa0 If one day they get an auto or a bus in 5 minutes, the next day they may end up waiting for 25 minutes.\xa0 Their plans often go awry.', 'The best aspect of this service is the predictability for a person to reach a station.\xa0 Every day, one reaches the station in 15 minutes.\xa0 Besides saving time and money.', 'Q: What is the kind of social impact your\xa0organization has succeeded in bringing about?', 'Q : What are the future plans for FreMo ?Are you thinking of expanding to other states?', 'Yes.\xa0 Fremo intends to move to all other cities and make this a phenomenon across various cities.\xa0 Next we would look at launching it in Pune, Bangalore, Chennai and New Delhi.', 'We hope the idea is a runaway success and we all get to reap its immense benefits at the earliest.\nFor further details, please visit their website: http://www.fremo.in/\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Writer, Researcher interested in social enterprise, innovation, culture and networks.

1,2010-4,"['Archives', 'Unsung Hero: Vipul Thaker']","['\n\n\nby\n\nGuest Reporter\n\n\nApril 20, 2010, 7:58 am \n\n\n', 'This article is dedicated to one of the many unsung heroes bringing about a change. His name is Vipul Thaker, a simple man with simple dreams. Without going into his background, let me start from one of his birthdays. It was on that day when he decided he wanted to do something different. He decided to educate a Rabari (a tribe in Gujarat) child. A makeshift classroom was created on the terrace of his two bedroom house. As days passed by, Vipul went on to explore the talent in the slum surrounding his housing society. A few more students joined his class and subsequently the classroom was shifted to a light post on a nearby road. His class had no roof and was hence exposed to the harsh elements of the weather. The classes went on nevertheless. Every evening at around 09.00 pm the class would commence.', 'Within one year Vipul had around twenty children who worked in the day time and regularly attended his evening classes.', 'Looking at the progress of this informal school, the parents who belonged to the Rabari community came to his aid. They gifted Vipul with an empty hut to which the classes now moved. Of all the problems that Vipul faced, one was that of gender discrimination. The girls were not allowed to study. After much persuasion from Vipul, the parents were convinced and the girls walked in for the very first time. Within a month their strength doubled.', 'This school wasn’t Vipul’s full time profession. He had a day job. He did receive some voluntary contribution from a few NRIs. After a point, he decided to admit his students in to a municipal school. Additionally, the evening classes were regularly conducted to ensure students did not miss out in case they didn’t go to school in the day.', 'Vipul had a dream to nurture – he wanted every child to get education on par with what their more privileged peers got. He negotiated with the private school principals, head masters, teachers and finally led to the introduction of a scholarship scheme. And so today out of forty students, around twenty five of them have been admitted to a school with better amenities for the students.', 'In the last few years, some of his students have shown their skills at the state level in the field of dramatic and graphic arts. Today he can proudly say that these children have something to look forward to. They have a future too. Vipul considers the renowned Gujarati educationist Gijubhai Badheka as his source of inspiration. He believes that Gandhian ideals too have been a prominent force behind his willingness to contribute selflessly.', 'The important thing, dear readers, is that this man and many more like him are actually striving to provide an identity to these children. They are providing a platform through which these children can express their ideas and needs.', 'Vipul and thousands of such grassroots revolutionaries are working towards bringing a constructive change in the society and we salute them for their relentless work in making a better India.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

But here is an organization where social responsibility is not just a residue of its profits, but the core purpose that guides its existence. Mirakle Couriers was born with a business idea that will support the livelihood of deaf adults.', 'There is no charity here, it is business, it is employment for the deaf. Mirakle simply touched the biggest pain point in the lives of the disabled, their employment. Their talents are all hidden and forgotten. The possibility of them being able to do something is never given a thought and we have them excluded from the mainstream. Moved by this very stigma, Dhruv Lakra founded Mirakle Couriers and invested his trust on the abilities of the deaf.', 'Based out of Mumbai, this organization started off with just two deaf boys in their team. Now the team has grown to 35 boys and 15 girls. The boys are entrusted with the responsibility of delivering the couriers while the girls work at the office. The employees at Mirakle have come in from different backgrounds and have stories to share that will tear our hearts apart. Abusive families, exploiting work environments, seclusion and what not. But their lives have changed. They are today earning members of their families. They are respected, independent and they love the job they are doing.', 'Bhupesh, an employee at Mirakle who has suffered a horrific past says: “I asked a deaf friend if he could help me find a job. He took me to meet Dhruv. Now that I am at Mirakle, I can finally feed my brother and myself. I give thanks to my God everyday for this opportunity. I am the only deaf person in my whole village and I have no friends. Life is stressing there. Mirakle provides me with friends who are all deaf like me. I can finally talk to someone like me, share a joke and just enjoy life.”', 'The biggest success of Mirakle Couriers lies in being able to give a respectable livelihood to the deaf. Mirakle goes to schools for the deaf to hire its people. The word about the opportunity at Mirakle has spread among the deaf with more and more people coming to join in. This unique people force is bringing success to the business which in return is spreading silent smiles of happiness.', 'You could help Mirakle Couriers by urging your company to use the services of this novel initiative.

The stark monotony of the arid landscape in this region is relieved by the bright shades of handicrafts made by the tribal women. Specifically, the Okhamandal Taluka is home to more than 200 Self Help Groups (SHGs) of men and women. It is from these communities that the Appliqué handicraft under the “Okhai” brand name has been created with the support and guidance of TCSRD (Tata Chemicals Society for Rural Development).', 'The Self Help Groups in Okhamandal Taluka mainly comprise of the Rabaris, Vagher and Ahirs. The most prominent tribe here, the Rabaris, are a semi-nomadic tribe known for their survival and adaptation in arid regions of Gujarat and Rajasthan – pursuing a pre-agrarian, pastoral lifestyle – found mainly in the Kutch and Saurashtra regions of Gujarat. The Rabaris today lead a quaint, colourful and rugged life which finds a manifestation in the embroidery and crafts made by them.', 'The TCSRD centre employs the skills of about 200 Rabari women from the various Okhamanda villages and a team of trained tailors. The various products made in Okhai include apparels, accessories and handicrafts. The handicrafts workforce is guided by a full time designer to translate the traditional products into those that are in consonance with the current fashion trends. These products are sold at retail showrooms in Mithapur and Ahemdabad. The products are an amalgamation of the traditional art form of the Tribal Women and the designs of the designer.', 'As their website puts its, “The Okhai brand has become a powerful statement by the women of Okhamandal villages over the years. A statement that empowers them, a statement that gives them and the region an identity, a statement that make people notice this beautiful form of art and patronize it.”', 'What we’ve found particularly interesting is the impact that these self-help groups are creating on the community members. Do read the following tales of empowerment at the Okhai website:\nLaxmi Bhara – Chief designer. She has been associated with the project for over 8 years and now is a proud owner of a home.\nRami Dula Nangesh – Empowerment personified. Her day with Okhai starts at 5 in the morning and she has been instrumental in bringing about innovative changes to the various products.', 'More about Okhai here: http://www.okhai.org/\nTo read about Tata Chemicals Society for Rural Development (TCSRD) click here: http://www.tcsrd.org/', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
