Innovator Vikram Dinubhai Panchal’s simple and cost-effective answer to the problem is for anyone to try out!', 'In a doubt-infested global economy where prices are skyrocketing and the future seems bleak, the supply and demand theory makes very little sense. Being self-sufficient is the smart thing to do. Innovator Vikram Dinubhai Panchal promulgates this theory with an added edge – that of cost-effectiveness. ‘Why not use a few easily available, low-cost materials to make something yourself?’- is the core idea behind his creation: a Do-It-Yourself Torch.', 'An industrial designer and lecturer by profession, Panchal chose one of the most common household items as his experiment- a light-bulb torch. Created in 1898 by Joshua Lionel Cowen, the original owner of the American Eveready Battery company, the world’s first flashlight soon turned into a household necessity. In the last hundred years, advances in technology have resulted in torches with a variety of new and innovative styles and features, including operations such as working underwater or in high-temperature conditions. But more features also translate into higher prices.', 'Innovation must never rely on cost, believes Panchal. Hence the approach to designing the DIY torch, which he aptly calls the Personal Light Source Torch, was an austere, minimalistic one. Can a person from any strata of society make this DIY torch, we ask him. “Of course! Being an academician, I always think of problems and projects, both simple and technically complex products, for myself and for my students. This automatically led me to imagine the scope of a new design, where there is no client or a sponsor. Hence, the desire to create using basic ingredients.”', 'The DIY torch is made up of simple components like a bulb of 2.6 watts, power cells of 1.5 watts, a connecting wire and the body. As for the body, it is made of plastic poly propylene, which can be obtained by reusing common office files, thereby reducing the overall cost. And to put it all together, you can make do with a paper cutter or in case of mass production, a laser cutter. An added advantage of poly propylene is its sustainability as a material. It is durable, washable and does not get damaged easily.', '“The DIY torch, if mass-produced, will have an instructional manual with illustrations and guidelines enabling anyone to make it easily,” Panchal is quick to add. And the cost? “A normal torch in India costs approximately Rs. 30. This DIY flashlight, if mass produced, will cost approximately Rs. 15.', 'For now, Panchal’s design is sure to give ample pleasure to someone who is smart about gathering and re-using the few above-mentioned ingredients to create a torch, which can be a handy emergency light, an excellent travel companion, or could even be used in medical emergencies or varied army usages. The designer adds,', 'You don’t need any formal education or training to create this torch; this encourages many, from students to craftsmen, to make it themselves. While students may explore it from the learning point of view, craftsmen or even a lay person may try it as a self-employment option.', 'There is also a fun aspect to it. “’Do it yourself’ saves time and allows you to make modifications in the product because, in essence, one becomes the designer and the user of their own product. Imagine, wouldn’t making a cigar and then smoking it be the ultimate joy for passionate cigar smokers?” quips Panchal.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
1,2012-10,"['Archives', 'TBI Inspiration: Divyanshu Ganatra – The Blind Shrink And Mountaineer']","['Clinical Psychologist by profession, trekker by passion, Divyanshu Ganatra is a self-made social entrepreneur. We find out how one can be all this while being blind.', 'In 1998, after a severe bout of tuberculosis, 21-year-old Divyanshu Ganatra’s health had started giving up on him. As he lay on the operating table with a ruptured lung, the doctors, unwilling to operate, were in a haste to declare him dead, before he blurted out, “Just hurry up and cut me open will you? I’m still alive, what the heck!”', 'A near death experience narrated with natural nonchalance by the clinical Psychologist. Ganatra however isn’t as kind with words while beginning to talk about glaucoma, which was diagnosed when he was just in standard 12th. “I didn’t believe it, I didn’t want to. But when I lost my vision completely, I had to,” he talks of the vision impairment that it later led to. It was a life-changing event and only the beginning of a series of challenges, first of which was to keep learning after quitting school. “I didn’t do it because I couldn’t see, I just felt I wasn’t learning anything,” he recalls.', 'An accidental entry into the world of disability had many shocks in store for Ganatra. “I checked into a rehab centre, where I was told I’d be taught to make chalk, cane furniture or become a telephone operator,” he talks about living conditions which can best be described as unhygienic. To the caretakers who told him he couldn’t make a career outside that circle, he simply retorted, “You can’t decide for me, I have lost my eyesight, not my dignity.” Not surprisingly, his rehab did not last for more than an hour.', 'Around 1995, when India’s IT sector had just begun its boom. Ganatra decided he would learn the intricacies of computing. But when all institutions shut their doors to him, he sought friends who would read out every command and screen. His hard work and of course the buoyancy of the sector bagged him an award from none other than the President of India. But “that was when I left IT. I had proved my point – people without vision are still people and can do much more,” he tells us.', 'Another reason for his exit from IT was his penchant for conversation. While machines provided him with a challenge, friends and family provided joy. Understanding happiness and the human mind got him to make an intriguing turn towards degrees in Psychology. The admission process, which is tough for the sighted, was even tougher for him. Denied admission although he had the required marks, Ganatra wrote a letter to the principal. “He replied saying there is a rule that says visually impaired persons can be denied admission; I asked him to show it to me.”', 'The graduation began with calling an educated person’s bluff to secure admission. The ensuing struggle, thanks to unhelpful teachers during his Master of Arts, only made him more adamant on completing the course. “I was graded D in their papers. I didn’t mind because they couldn’t fail me. I surprised them by being the first to get placed in my batch,” he flaunts. Working at The Tata Group in the HR department, he realised that that was not his path to the ‘Land of Oz’ and decided to create his own, literally.', '‘Yellow Brick Road’, his company, is inspired by his favourite movie, The Wizard of Oz. “Besides providing corporate training and counseling, we offer parallel academia,” he informs. “We teach students of Psychology the practical application of what they study in college, using case studies and role-plays. More importantly, we teach them that the person comes first. Nobody is a ‘schizophrenic person,’ one is a ‘person with schizophrenia.’ Sure he may have delusions and hallucinate, but there is so much more to him. He can be fun and lively as anyone else,”\xa0he goes on, his voice giving away his heart’s empathy.', 'The Pune-based shrink is also a troublesome mountaineer by choice. And only after a long chat with him does it become apparent that true achievers are marked by their passion more than profession. After his tuberculosis surgery, Ganatra had to go through the stages of learning to walk all over again. His frail 32 kg body even forced him to crawl. Today, he has scaled the Milam Glacier and the Kumaon range of the Himalayas among other peaks.', '“I only feel for the poor Sherpas. They’re the ones who have to guide me uphill, a task that will be tougher now because of my ever increasing belly!” he laughs. Ganatra weighs more than double of his frail days and treks not in the pursuit of brownie points, but just to refresh perspectives. At a time when athletes around the world are competing for that medal of gold, it is inspiring to meet someone who has a heart of one.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
2,2012-10,"['Archives', 'The Nirmal Bharat Yatra – Breaking the Menstrual Taboo And Other Barriers']","['\n\n\nby\n\nAneesha Menon\n\n\nOctober 25, 2012, 12:40 pm \n\n\n', 'Aneesha Menon, an India Water Portal Fellow, travels with The Nirmal Bharat Yatra (Great WASH Yatra) to understand the mindset in rural India on health and sanitation issues and to educate young girls on the menstrual cycle and hygienic practices. While the lack of awareness is shocking, Aneesha finds an eagerness to learn and adapt which is encouraging. On visiting two schools to take a survey, she is happy to note that their visit seems to have left a positive impact on the young minds.', 'For over decades, there has been this taboo towards menstruation that it’s unclean, dirty or even treated as something that is embarrassing. Women in India are treated as untouchables or even worse during their menstrual cycle. Have we ever stopped to think why we let this happen? Why are we constantly victimizing women when this is a routine procedure that is part of their womanhood?', 'Stepping into their teens isn’t the happiest of memories for many, especially for girls from rural parts of India. For them talking about their first period openly to anyone is considered a shameful act to an extent that they are not allowed to continue with their routine life and are asked not to use the same facilities as the family uses.', 'Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC) at The Great Wash Yatra conducted a survey based on Menstrual Hygiene Management which allowed us to go to schools and understand the problems faced by the girls. This helped in giving me a clear insight into menstrual management. We were divided into groups and sent to various schools in the district to take surveys regarding the menstrual hygiene management. As the menstrual cycle is considered a taboo, girls of that age end up knowing very little about the basic steps to be followed. Most of them use cloth instead of sanitary napkins, and many of them don’t understand it and wonder why it happens. Due to not taking proper care during the period, many of them end up having a lot of health related problems. Our aim was to understand their emotions, reactions and also create an awareness towards the topic. We were accompanied by volunteers from The Centre of Sciences for Villages. In our survey the girls belonged to class 7.', 'Our first stop was at a village called Surgana in Maharashtra. We were directed by the Principal to the allocated class .The boys and girls were eager to know the purpose of our visit. We started out by asking them to draw their dream school. All of them took a minute to think and then took out their pencils to starting drawing.', 'After they were done, the boys were taken out of the class so that we could talk to the girls about their menstrual hygiene. In a class of 20 girls, only 2 of them had started their cycle. Out of the two girls, one of them was very shy and embarrassed to talk about it but with the encouragement from her teachers, she answered our questions. The other girl was happier to share it with someone other than her friends and that she was allowed to talk about it openly. After we were done with our survey, we educated the other girls in the class about menstrual hygiene. Also we told them that it was completely normal to talk about it and there was nothing to be ashamed of as every girl gets it at a certain age, it is an integral part of her womanhood and they should feel proud about it. The teachers in the school were very helpful and also kept asking us questions. Seeing this, the girls felt a lot more confident about the topic in hand. After our session with the girls, the boys were called back in. From the various drawings we had collected from the children, we selected one which had all the facilities including washrooms, dustbins etc. They all looked enlightened and seemed happy with the knowledge that they had gained.', 'The second school we went to was in a slightly bigger village called Arvi. It was an all girl’s school with around 10 girls who had started their cycle. What was different here was that the most of them used sanitary napkins and were more aware. They were eager to know more and asked us many questions related to the topic. It seemed like they were happy that they didn’t have to be embarrassed talking about it. One of them kept asking us questions and didn’t give the others a chance. It was overwhelming to see their enthusiasm and willingness to acquire information.', 'Overall it was an eye-opening experience for me which helped me getting a clear insight. Living in urban cities we don’t really know what’s happening in the rural areas. For us, it’s our monthly cycle which is treated very casually but in most of the villages, many girls are kept at home, in a separate room and are not allowed to talk about it. We complain about the pain we go through during our period but they are the actual victims. When they are asked about how they allow themselves to be treated like that, they reply with a smile saying they don’t have any complaints. But after our survey they seemed more aware, and also more confident that in the future they will have the courage to go up to a shop and buy a sanitary napkin.', 'The Nirmal Bharat Yatra, also called the The Great WASH Yatra is a multichannel, mega-campaign that harnesses the positive power of Cricket and Bollywood to promote awareness and enact behavioural change around sanitation and hygiene in India. The Nirmal Bharat Yatra has been developed by WASH United and Quicksand, in collaboration with the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan. It is a huge carnival travelling across North India, from Wardha in Maharashtra to Bettiah in Bihar. The Yatra has games designed around sanitation and hygiene, a Menstrual Hygiene Lab to advise women on safe menstrual hygiene, and many entertaining and innovative ways to engage with rural audiences on the importance of sanitation. It is a one-of-a-kind attempt to solve India’s sanitation crisis, and is supported by the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India.', 'India Water Portal is a media partner for the event.

3,2012-10,"['Archives', 'TBI Heritage: Acoustic Traditional – Preserving Indigenous Tales, Myths and Legends']","['\n\n\nby\n\nMalavika Tewari\n\n\nOctober 22, 2012, 2:17 pm \n\n\n', 'India is estimated to have about 635 indigenous communities. Each of these groups of people have a unique identity, with their very own brand of culture, traditions and folklore. Unfortunately, most of this knowledge is passed on from generation to generation in the oral form, and in the face of dwindling tribal population, advent of modern education and widespread displacement in the name of development, most of this ancient wisdom is getting eroded. This is where a group of individuals calling themselves Acoustic Traditional are making an effort to preserve the precious heritage.', '“Once upon a time…the kind king got married…together they slayed many demons…and then the king and the queen lived happily ever after…”', 'Do you relate to similar stories your Grandma would have narrated to you a few years back? I remember listening to fairy tales and mythological stories from my parents and grandparents before switching off to my dream world of imaginations. Then while I was growing I graduated from story listener to book reader and then to a story teller. I guess many of us share a similar upbringing. This time The Better India got a beautiful and extensive opportunity to know, interact and hear stories from Acoustic Traditional (AT).', 'It was during the year of 1999 in Nepal, when Mr. Salil Mukhia Kwoica and Ms. Barkha Henry thought about preserving the mountain folk music by documenting and transcribing them into sheet music (staff notations) in the hope that the music would be available for the generations to come. Mr. Salil Mukhia Kwoica says,', 'I was teaching music at one of the schools in Kathmandu those days and often found time to travel the country side to listen to some old folk tunes which I would send to Barkha (who was in Darjeeling). She would then transcribe it for an instrument (usually Guitar). However, the process of documentation quickly revealed a vast arena of study as we came across the stories, myths and legends on which the music was originally based. The realization that these stories, myths and legends were in fact the bed rock of the community’s identity, culture and heritage and that they were becoming extinct as they were passed down from one generation to another usually through ‘oral storytelling traditions’, led us to study this area and to include a wider community in our work.', 'There are many indigenous communities, where population is gradually reducing and the only way their history passes on is by oral narration usually from a Shaman to his successor (a Shaman is the head/priest of the community). However with urbanization, such history is becoming lost and remains untold to the younger generations. This is where AT has taken the initiative and works in the area of documenting the oral history, the community stories, and their way of life etc, through research and dissemination projects. Their flagship annual event “the Festival of Indigenous Storytellers” is one such initiative which brings together tribal storytellers from across the country in view of sharing their stories with the world.', 'These narrations are not just stories but have a lot of significance in day to day rituals and are a matter of anthropological study and research. Example: Mr. Salil Mukhia Kwoica, once narrated “For a particular period in the year, some communities worship the river and do not kill the fishes; it is not superstition but actually in this month, fishes swim upstream to reproduce and lay eggs and hence should not be killed.” All such practices are relevant and interwoven by AT. Currently, they have been traveling around Eastern Himalayas – Sikkim region and documenting folklore on Yeti and have come across many people who claim to have seen the Yeti. AT is working day and night, enjoying living with the community members and capturing their stories and planning to extend this research trip to Nepal and Bhutan.', 'It was an engrossing time discussing stories and obtaining views and opinions of Mr Salil Mukhia Kwoica, Ms Minket Lepcha and Ms Barkha Henry. Below is an excerpt of the interview by the group:', 'Acoustic looks at working especially with mountain and forest based communities – also those communities which are seemingly vanishing (in terms of population) and where the documentation of oral traditions is nonexistent. Our focus areas have been Eastern Himalayas and the Nilgiris.', 'But in terms of storyteller identification/participation, we have a national reach (Karnataka/ Tamil Nadu/ Andhra Pradesh/ West Bengal/ Manipur/ Nagaland/ Sikkim/ etc.)', 'How would you describe your work life? How would a day of yours be like?', 'Ms Minket Lepcha: “As a documentalist my day involves working around with interviews mostly with the community elders, especially the Shamans. The interviews usually imply gathering of information on the community’s oral mythology and folklore. This depends on the nature of the project, but usually these are the things that I document. My work is mostly based in tribal villages (in Dzongu at the moment) and starts early. I often have to walk long distances to meet up with the people, sometime it takes over a day just to reach a particular community by walk. I usually spend over a week’s time at the informant’s house just to get him/her comfortable with speaking. Since most of the Shamans are old it is difficult for them to recollect stories, myths etc. and many times I join them in their household chores trying to get the story out.', 'However, documenting in a community is an extensive task and the engagement with the community is for a very long time, sometimes even years as we have to understand them and how they function for them to be comfortable enough to share their stories with us.”', 'What are the fun aspects and the challenges involved?', 'It is always fun in the field as the terrain is scenic and at times spiritual. Interacting with the community, being invited to their ceremonies, rituals, sometimes being chased by children and old drunken storytellers is even more fun. At the end, we make up a family.', 'Accessibility to the villages has been a major concern because the weather changes drastically in the mountains in a short span of time causing landslides. In winters the snowfall is very heavy and that is the time when I have to postpone my scheduled visit to the villages. The other major challenge is to correctly interpret the storytellers because of the language barrier. Though a local translator is also accompanying, however a lot of ethnic words do not have an equal expression in English hence get dissolved in the process of translation.', 'The Lepchas or the ‘Rongkup’ (being their original tribe name) are the aboriginal people of Sikkim and Darjeeling in the Eastern Himalayas. Their belief system is based on nature worship headed by a ‘Bongthing’ (Male Shaman) or a Mun (Female Shaman). They are also one of the oldest tribes in the region.', 'It is often quoted that the tribal communities are getting disconnected from the rest of the populace over the years. What is your take on that? ', 'While this might be a popular notion and in many developmental ways true, there is this entire phenomenon of them being de-rooted from their own community structures due to persistent developmental attitudes that governments, educational institutions etc. bring in. Of course they remain marginalized in terms of their bigger picture but what remains true is the fact that their meaningful development can be asserted not by coercive mainstreaming but by understanding them – the relevance of their amazing traditional knowledge, rituals, practices, oral history etc. In fact this is one priority area of Acoustic Traditional work – to bring out their relevance in their urban context.', 'Ms Barkha Henry’s take on the same: “But I think that disconnect with their own rich traditional base is more critical to take note of. In this regard, we are losing account of mankind’s primitive history and social/ spiritual development; Anthropologically this is a very big loss.', 'It may be surprising to note but the whole notion of mainstreaming them is so intrusive and devastating, that it is making them quite disabled. We need to understand that tribal communities bring in their own “scientific heritage” and knowledge systems. Removing that completely from them and giving them a “new” education has hardly helped anything. In fact, in terms of sustainability and conservation, we still find that their mechanisms are far more effective than what most modern means offer.', 'As such, the context of integrating them organically is far more critical than merely mainstreaming them using mainstream ideas. I feel that first the general populace needs to understand them.”', 'Thank you so much for taking time to respond. Is there anything more you would like to share with our readers?', 'Ms Minket: “While I was listening and documenting stories – which are simple and yet so wise – it made me realize the importance that these stories held for the community. It was these stories that bound them together. The fact that I belonged to the same community and was coming closer to myself through these stories gave me a whole new experience and understanding of the lingering question of ‘why they do things the way they do?’ which I had in my mind. Most of the stories, when studied closely, had a reason to co-exist harmoniously as per my understanding.”', 'When we asked the organization about the external support structure, Mr. Salil Mukhia Kwoica shared with us that they greatly valued individual support, where school children and working professionals are involved, and all of them together arrange funds by creating activities (story telling sessions, workshops etc), documenting and publishing stories. They organized a “Big Foot Campaign” in Darjeeling where students actively participated and roamed around in big shoes and the campaign was a huge success. They also receive some amount of Government support.', 'They are organizing their annual event – A Festival of Indigenous Storytellers, Confluence – III, on a big scale in the month of December.

During the off-season, men go to the cities in search of work and women, who have to care for children, stay behind, jobless. At the same time, her area grows areca nut trees, whose leaves are left to rot. Or rather were left to rot until one day when Archana got the idea to turn these leaves into biodegradable plates. Now she hires 3 women and 1 young man to work with her, and buys raw materials from 40 others farmers. Her plates reach markets in France and the UK. Archana employs 44 people and has transformed her village economy, and her story is among those many compelling stories that ‘Going to School’ narrates to poor children who are at the maximum risk of dropping out of school.', 'Lisa Heydlauff was once asked by Oliver, age 7, in one of the classes where she was teaching in the UK – ‘What is it like to go to school in India?’ This triggered something inside her to such an extent that she packed her bags and came to India in pursuit of an answer. She found that going to school is not so easy in most parts of the country. Many children do not make it to school and among those who make it, not many stay on. Almost 50% of our children, 83% of girls in Bihar, drop out of school before class 10. Many efforts are being made to help students stay in school, but what about those who are obviously dropping out? How will these children take their lives forward? Lacking skills, education and guidance – it’s a battle for a lifetime.', 'We all love to be told a story. There is magic, there’s beauty and there is an unknown power in stories. Lisa took this simple fact of life to solve this complex problem – the task of inspiring poor children to complete their schooling and of improving the lives of those children who drop out of school. That was the beginning of ‘Going to School’, an organization with a beautiful belief – ‘The key to changing the world just might be to tell an epic story to a child in India’.', 'Lisa set off on a travel across India with Nitin Upadhye, a photographer – by rickshaw, by train, by foot – to find stories of children who have braved their odds to go to school. And she found 25 inspiring stories that could be retold to children so that they get to see the possibilities that can open up before them by going to school. These real life stories from across India were put together in a form of a book with colourful designs and powerful words – ‘Going to school in India’.', '‘Going to School’ has since been taking its books free-of-cost to various government schools, to the poorest of children and impacting their lives. The inclusion of ‘Going to School’ stories in NCERT textbooks made sure that over 10 million children get to read these inspiring stories every year. Their most moving set of stories is perhaps what they’re rolling out now in 1,000 Government Secondary Schools in Bihar. ‘Be! an Entrepreneur’ stories are about young heroes who live in poverty and start businesses that solve local problems – water, waste, energy – their businesses are for-profit, generate income for the entrepreneur and create jobs. Watch a movie about Be! Schools in Bihar.\n', '‘Be! Books’ teach 50 entrepreneurial skills from building relationships to making cash-flow statements. 300,000 children in Class 9 read one book once a week with their teachers and complete the skills project activity over the weekend. Students are given training to become little entrepreneurs, taught how to begin a small business, create business plans, budget plans and cash statements though their weekly skills training workshops. Students, who normally answer that they want to become doctors and engineers when they grow up, have started identifying themselves with this new possibility of entrepreneurship. These classrooms are showing energies like never before.', 'Lisa and her team took their belief in the power of entrepreneurship to the next level by reaching out to support the business ideas of young people from poor backgrounds. They found that there were many young people who wanted to solve social issues in their villages and neighbourhoods by starting off small businesses, but they would never find the financial backing for it. ‘Be! Fund’ was formed to provide capital and business support to these youngsters; like Ramakrishna, who wants to set up an affordable transport business to help farmers of his village send their produce to the market; like Poonam, who wants to provide nutritious food to low-income employees. These entrepreneurs become the solution providers for poverty in their own small ways – small ways that when put together will have the potential to solve poverty on a massive scale, as Lisa believes, and it’s all wrapped up in the most beautiful story they can dare to tell to children who need them the most.', 'To know more about Going to School – http://www.goingtoschool.com/', '(Photos courtesy: Going to School)\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

He also meets Paul, the person who has held them together for more than twenty-five years, and has immense faith in his ‘family’.\xa0', 'Based in a small, neat campus, Asha Niketan, located in Koramangala, is truly the ‘Abode of Hope’ that its name says it is, as I’ve learnt from occasionally visiting it over the last several months. Its charter describes it as a community of people ‘with and without intellectual disabilities’, sharing life together, and ‘celebrating the value of every person’ based on ‘mutual relationships and trust in God’.', 'Home to a community of some forty amazing people, around thirty of Asha Niketan’s members are ‘intellectually challenged’ adults, the rest being assistants who live with them as members of a small family. Although Bangalore has several institutions catering to ‘mentally retarded’ people, Asha Niketan is probably the only one that is structured as a family unit, providing its members love, warmth and care which most ‘normal’ families lack.', 'Fourteen of the ‘intellectually challenged’ members of the Asha Niketan family live on campus, in cheerful and airy rooms. Some of them have no family members or have been abandoned by them. The rest are what are called day workers, living with their parents or other family members and commuting to Asha Niketan five days a week. Their age ranges from 20 years onwards. The oldest, Georgie, is 85. Their mental age ranges from one to about five, and some of them suffer additional handicaps related to speech and physical disability.', 'Paul, the current leader of the community, has served in Asha Niketan for some twenty-five years. He was a fresh graduate when he volunteered to spend his holidays in the centre and in a short while decided to make it his life’s vocation, staying on ever since. ‘It’s the love that I receive and am able to share with members of this family that keeps me going,’ he says. Serving the mentally-challenged is Paul’s way of serving God. “Being their friend, so that they know that there is someone for them, gives me the satisfaction that I am fulfilling a purpose in my life. A well-paying job elsewhere could never give me that. Life isn’t all about making money, after all,” he explains.', 'But it isn’t just the love he gives and the service to people rejected by society that he renders that has kept Paul going for most of his life as an active member of the Asha Niketan community. He believes,', 'Sharing their joys and pains, everyday I learn so many new things from our family. From them I’ve learnt how to love and forgive – they are very loving and hold no bitterness in their hearts. They are innocent, spontaneous and transparent, unlike so-called normal people, and speak from their hearts, just as they feel, without any pretence or calculation. It isn’t that they don’t occasionally fight with each other, but they soon forget all about it. They are spiritual in their own wonderful ways. They’ve taught me how suffering can be transformed into love.', 'Life at Asha Niketan follows a regular pattern. Members get up early – some need the help of assistants to bathe, shave and for other early morning necessities. Breakfast is followed by half an hour of silent meditation, which is sometimes accompanied by soft instrumental music. Then, after they chat a bit they set about working in one of the many small workshops located within the premises. Work is light, but it helps the members spend their time productively and together, giving them a sense of self-worth as productive members of society and as also capable of earning just as everyone else.', 'Visit Asha Niketan on any weekday and you’ll find its member laughing and cracking jokes as they go about weaving mufflers and bath-mats, smoothening bits of bamboos to be made into picture-frames and pen-holders, embroidering bits of cloth to turn into greeting cards, folding old newspapers into paper-bags, and making candles. After lunch and an hour’s break it is back to the workshops – sunny, fun-filled workspaces – till tea-time, after which everyone comes together again to chat or play. Once a week the family goes out – to the local park or to a temple or church, where they spend the pocket-money that they earn from their work on ice-cream and juice and generally have fun. Once a year, the entire family goes on a vacation – to a hill-station or a beachside town.', 'Occasionally, volunteers drop by and spend time at Asha Niketan, and some, particularly from abroad, choose to spend up to several months living as part of the family for an inspiring learning experience and exposure to an amazing way to live, love, care and share. Volunteers can serve in many ways: helping in the workshops and promoting their products, mobilising funds, assisting in the kitchen, and, best of all, chatting with and helping members of the family.', 'Members of the Asha Niketan family come from diverse religious, caste and class backgrounds but are mercifully unaware of such humanly-constructed differences. Seeing them love, laugh, argue, chat, work, cry, shout, play and meditate together, you’d definitely wish all other families were that way! And, as you will definitely agree, what a wonderfully different world it would then be!', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
7,2012-10,"['Archives', 'TBI Tribute: Dr. Verghese Kurien – Lest We Forget']","['Dr. Verghese Kurien left us exactly one month ago.\xa0Fondly known by various names like the Milkman of India and Father of the White Revolution, he not only changed the lives of millions of dairy farmers in the nation but boosted the dairy industry to such an extent as to make India the largest milk-producer in the world. Let us pay tribute to the man who gave us so much, and to whom we never gave the Bharat Ratna. Let us read about him one more time – Lest we forget!', 'Dr. Verghese Kurien – the man who came to Anand almost 60 years ago after completing his graduation in the US, had decided to leave soon in search of better opportunities. But something made him stay back forever – the “billion-litre” idea – to transform the life of millions of milk producers in the country — and he stayed on to become the “Milkman of India”, the Father of the White Revolution.', 'Hardly would one find a young graduate with a lucrative career ahead settling to improve the lives of the poor, but Dr. Kurien was an extraordinary man who cherished a dream for the dairy industry of India.', 'Kurien was only 28 when he came to Anand in Gujarat in 1949, and was soon working relentlessly to help a budding co-operative grow. For him the dairy farmers were the rightful owners of the milk business. By 1955, the co-operative owned Asia’s largest dairy and was producing more than 20,000 litres of milk a day. This is when AMUL (meaning priceless), Asia’s top milk-distributing brand today, was born. Soon Anand had been transformed from a small village in the country to the Milk Capital of India.', 'Kurien replicated the Anand model throughout India as Operation Flood, making India the world’s largest producer of milk. Not only did Gujarat’s farmers benefit immensely from Kurien’s work, the other milk producing states such as Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh also started flourishing under Kurien’s guidance. He is hailed as an iconic figure who transformed Bihar and gave the milk revolution to the state, while he was the chairman of the Patna Dairy Project. He strongly believed that by placing technology and professional management in the hands of the farmers, the living standards of millions of rural poor could be improved. His creation of community owned cooperatives empowered millions of rural families, mostly landless and small farmers, in India. Today over 10 million farmers across the country at 200 dairies produce over 20 million litres of milk a day. It was due to success of the Operation Flood model that India achieved the laurel of becoming the largest milk producing nation globally. India today contributes about 17 per cent of the total milk production in the world. Kurien’s revolutionary efforts in the milk industry helped the milk producers in the country produce milk powder from buffalo milk while the rest of the world used cow milk to make milk powder.', 'Kurien was an excellent marketing person. He marketed the “Anand Success Story” as a management model for rural institutional development wherein a commodity was used as a tool for socio-economic development. In order to improve the liquid milk marketing system across the country, Kurien set up a milk intervention programme, a national milk grid, under the Operation Flood programme. Through the milk grid he ensured that surpluses from higher milk produce areas reached deficit areas. At the demand side, he established Mother Dairy and bulk vending system which could deliver loose hygienic milk at a reasonable price to the urban consumers in competition with the loose milk supplied by city milk dwellers. He not only established around 30 institutions of excellence including AMUL, GCMMF, IRMA, NDDB but also created several grassroots institutions especially to provide skill-oriented training and encourage socio-economic development of the rural masses.', 'Winner of Padma Vibhushan (India’s second-highest civilian honour), the World Food Prize and the Magsaysay Award for community leadership, Dr. Kurien played an instrumental role in the marketing of award-winning director Shyam Benegal’s greatest work ‘Manthan’ featuring Kurien himself on the silver screen for his path-breaking initiatives in the milk co-operative movement. Kurien, however, had a painful exit from the institutions he founded. In 2006 he stepped down as founder-chairman of both GCMMF and IRMA. His detractors felt he was unduly clinging on to power.', 'It is indeed a matter of shame that the man who deserved much India’s highest civilian honour – the Bharat Ratna – was not conferred during his lifetime. After Kurien’s death, P.A Joseph, his former executive assistant, said, “We don’t want it now even if it is conferred.” Who could believe that the man who gave so many milk drinkers to the country, did not himself ever taste milk! Even if Dr. Kurien was not awarded Bharat Ratna, India salutes him for empowering the lives of millions of farmers and for bringing the Milk revolution in the country. Every young graduate can look forward to walk on the footsteps of this man, who made India a milk sufficient country on a global platform.', 'Amul’s’ mascot was seen weeping for the first time ever (since 1964) in an advertisement “Thank You For Giving us Hausla, Pragati & Anand……Dr V Kurien 1921-2012,” the ad read.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
8,2012-10,"['Archives', 'Barfi! – Reviewed By Experts In The Field Of Disability']","['Barfi! is a Bollywood film released recently which explores a complicated relationship between a deaf and mute person, an autistic person and a regular person. It is a refreshing film which draws us into the world of the disabled without carrying the weight of pity. However, it is not very accurate in its portrayal of the disabled, as the advocacy trust Trinayani tells us when they watch the movie with a few disabled friends and experts. We wish to present their eye-opening though subjective views here, and would welcome opinions and comments from our readers. Having said that, we do believe that Barfi! is a highly sensitive take on two major disabilities and our aim here is to make people more aware of these while bringing about a deeper perspective from different points of view. Caution: Spoilers Alert!', 'For a nation besotted with watching love stories of all shapes and budgets on 70mm, its film industry is more than glad to oblige by presenting at least one every week. That said, the number of mainstream film-makers choosing to depict the intriguing romances of persons with disability remains disappointingly low, those who’ve done it in the past decade countable on fingers. Last fortnight, we got a breath of fresh air (almost literally, in Darjeeling) with Anurag Basu’s Barfi!, a Chaplin-esque tale (treading the line between homage and plagiarism) of a deaf charmer and his subject of interest, a girl with autism. And to round-up our perspective, we took along to the movie two of our deaf friends and two experts on disability!', 'Watching Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra’s delightful tale unfold were Sohail Lakhani, one of the illustrious deaf students of Sanskardham College in Mumbai and his principal Lata Nayak. An exponent of the Indian Sign Language (ISL) and lip-reader par excellence Sunil Sahasrabudhe too was our deaf companion, along with Dr Rubina Lal, a lecturer of SNDT University and doctorate in autism. While the film per se is undoubtedly a delightful entertainer, what the people above told us about it over coffee later are crucial talking points to be noted for its makers and us, the candyfloss-loving audience.', 'First things first, our films being escapist exaggerations of realities, Barfi! is no different, for having taken liberties to make its lead characters do stuff real persons with disability don’t. “Deaf persons don’t have an inner language, hence they are not as imaginative in mischief as Barfi has been shown!” reacted Dr Lal. “Most of them are reserved in real life, often lacking basic confidence owing to an inferiority complex,” Principal Nayak added. And while Sunil feared Barfi’s ‘mischievous’ portrayal might send out a wrong message about deaf men, it cannot be denied that the caricature of the central character was endearing to watch, and a film is bound to take artistic liberties.', 'More insights from our representatives of the disability sector found gaping holes in Barfi!’s story. “An autistic person can in no way communicate a phone number to a stranger and place a call,” Dr Lal said of an important sequence in the film. She also added that ‘jealousy’ is an advanced emotion and is not to be found among those with autism, as depicted in the end. Also, in the climax (warning, spoilers ahead!) ‘Jhilmil’ shouting Barfi’s name repeatedly, with a desire to want him back, is unreal behaviour given her disability. So there, the dramatic end of the story falls like a house of cards – but is anyone complaining? We think not!', 'Perhaps our biggest peeve as lay audience is that after watching a full-length film with a lead character being autistic, we still don’t know about the disability means. Although, as Dr Lal, herself a mother of an autistic girl, lauded the detail that autistic persons are over-sensitive to mud/dust as depicted in the film, we didn’t know that autism is a neural disorder marked by developmental impairment and has affected over a crore people in India. Google told us, Basu didn’t.', 'And as for a peeve from the deaf community itself, here’s a piercing one: Isn’t it a pity that lakhs of those in India who live with Barfi’s disability in real life won’t be able to grasp the film? “I was expecting more signs and gestures,” Sohail expressed, adding, “It would’ve been heartening to see more of the ISL, with sub-titles to assist the hearing audience!”Of course he expected more from the director who bothered to come to his school himself for research. The moot point here is, deaf persons are almost invisible in our society; and when they don’t get assistance in important walks of public life, a simple luxury of a sub-titled film too was denied here. Ironically, Mr Basu and the producers will have no option but to subtitle the film when they send it to the Oscar jury for viewing!', 'Though we discussed more cracks in this otherwise charming-looking vintage mansion of a story, truth must be said that Barfi! brought to public consciousness a rarely talked about disability and another one which is complicated. “That’s what most public awareness efforts aim towards,” Dr Lal told us.', 'A Friday after Barfi!, we as a people were ready to be swept away by more romances, more exaggerated escapes from reality. But if Basu’s effort managed to open the minds of even a few who were deaf and blind to disability, the effort we say was totally worth it.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Her dedication is plainly visible as she recalls painful memories of last year’s floods in Odisha and the steps she took to ensure that the situation in her village remained under control.', 'Lean, tall and with a quiet demeanour, 40-year-old Pankajani Behra looks like any other ordinary woman in the village of Bhanjachura, in Odisha’s flood-ravaged, coastal district of Balasore. But she’s actually quite special. For very often this lady in blue – she is usually dressed immaculately in a sky blue sari – is the only source of hope in times of illness or any other medical emergency for the people of Bhanjachura. “She is like an angel for me. And why just me, for most of us here. I am here, alive and talking to you, only because of her. My baby is healthy today all thanks to her,” says Tikki Donphat, a young mother.', 'Behra is an accredited social health activist (ASHA) of the government’s flagship programme, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). Her official duties include spreading awareness about good health practices, immunisation campaigns and assisting the anganwadi worker or Auxillary Nurse Midwives (ANM) in ensuring that a pregnant woman in the village, and later her child, is well taken care of, before and after delivery.', 'Behra’s work, however, is hardly restricted to any rule book.', 'For the village people, I am the most visible and first point of contact for any health related issue. So no matter what the ailment, be it a headache, fever or stomach flu, besides pregnancy related issues, I get calls for help at all times.', 'And she’s ever ready to swing into action. Like in the case of the eight-months-pregnant Donphat, who went into labour suddenly and started bleeding. It was in the middle of the night and Behra was called immediately. As she rushed to help her, she called for the Janani Vahini, a government ambulance, which eventually transported Donphat to the district hospital, 10 kilometres away. Behra stayed with her for two days and later returned with the baby in tow, amid relieved smiles of the family.', 'She recalls another time when her timely intervention saved a village elder. “A few days back, I got a call from a village elder who said that he has been having constant headaches and wanted me to take him to the hospital. When I took him there, it turned out that he has a tumour. Thankfully the treatment has begun now,” she says.', 'Behra takes her work seriously. Armed with basic first aid knowledge and a kit that includes Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORS) sachets, iron and folic acid tablets, chloroquine, Disposable Delivery Kits (DDK) and condoms, she walks the narrow lanes of Bhanjachura daily, visiting households and interacting with the women and others. She says,', 'Sometimes there is a lot of work. But when you realise that you are better equipped to tackle a health condition than any other villager, you cannot turn down a call. After all, I took up the work of an ASHA six years back for this very reason.', 'Although each delivery that Behra assists in not easy, seeing that she has to make proper arrangements from her remote village, her real test came when Odisha was ravaged by floods last year. Nearly 2,600 villages were submerged and lakhs of people affected. And Balasore, a coastal district, in which Bhanjachura lies, was one of the worst-affected. She recalls, “It was in October, right after the floods. I had gone out for a few days on work and when I returned, I got a phone call as soon as I stepped off the bus. It was a frantic call from someone in the village — 13 children had fallen ill and the parents didn’t know what to do.”', 'When she reached the village, Behra understood that she was looking at the beginnings of what would soon become an epidemic. “I mobilised some people to help me provide ORS to the ill children and then started making arrangements for a vehicle to take them to the Remuna Community Health Centre (CHC). However, when I called the medical officer at the CHC, he told me that it was full. So I decided to take them to the district hospital.”', 'But that was not all. With water borne ailments spreading rapidly, others in the village started falling ill, too. “It was a terrible situation. There was no one else I could turn to for help and people were looking at me for guidance. I remember ferrying nearly 50 elders and more children to the hospital, all the time making phone calls and giving them ORS for rehydration. I don’t think I slept at all for three days, and just stayed with the patients,” she says.', 'For her commendable efforts in saving the lives of her village folk, Behra was given state recognition in the form of an award. But she says she would do it anyway. In fact, she doesn’t really go looking for credit or monetary compensation for all the hard work she puts in. “During those days I spent more than Rs 1,000 in vehicle charges and phone calls. For a person like me, that is a large amount. But I have not been reimbursed yet,” says she.', 'Incidentally, ASHAs get a performance-linked incentive. For each delivery she assists in, Behra gets Rs 350. Over the last six year she has assisted in 150 deliveries. So it’s not the money but the commitment that keeps them going. “You need commitment to do a job like this. I am married with children of my own, so I have a full fledged house and family to look after. But even then, this entire village is like my family and I am at their disposal when they need me,” she says.', 'While the NRHM guidelines state that a village of 1,000 population should have one ASHA, until last year Behra had the responsibility of catering to the entire population of two villages. It was only after the induction of another ASHA in the nearby village that her work has eased a little.', 'For the overall scenario of healthcare to improve even further, she believes that health infrastructure needs to be developed considerably, especially considering that the state has a maternal mortality of 258 (for every 100,000 live births), well above the national average of 212.', 'We need more ambulances. The Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) scheme promises free transportation to ferry a pregnant woman to the hospital, but there are times when we call the Janani vehicle and have to wait for a long time, because it is busy elsewhere in the block. Once, one woman gave birth at home during such a wait, thankfully everything was normal, but otherwise it would have been very dangerous situation.', 'But despite the challenges, the hard work and the odd hours she sometimes has to keep, Behra is happy. She pauses and then comments, “I like my job. Not only does it give me the financial independence and the ability to run my household, it also gives me immense satisfaction. There’s nothing like being able to bring hope to a helpless person’s life.”', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Nobody can really tell these children are deaf – they are so fluent in listening, understanding and speaking English as well as Tamil!\nSmiles, Smiles and Smiles! This is how I was welcomed at the Little Flower Convent Hr. Sec. School in G.N.Road, Chennai. Occupying a huge area near Gemini flyover, it is a lush green place filled with young enthusiastic children. The school was started way back in 1962 with one child; today it has 535 young minds. The school supports an excellent environment promoting not just education but all hidden talents they posses. With national and state award winning stints in both art and sport genre, the school also has been giving cent percent results at the board, says the Principal.', 'We focus on all the kids here, with no bias on religion, language or caste. Some of the children when they join, they are quite hesitant and shy, we make sure we bring them in front, make them break their shackles of fear, and interact. We strongly encourage listening and talking, use of sign language is not allowed.', 'The school aims in promoting education both in English and Tamil medium, free of cost, to all children. It trains teachers in the modern methodologies of teaching the deaf and works untiringly to integrate them into mainstream schools in order to provide them equal opportunities from an early age to lead a normal life like the rest. Also, deserving students are provided hearing aids free of cost with nominal repairing cost.', 'Sherley, a teacher in the school shares her experience. She says,', 'It was not a choice I made, I believe God chose me to do this. I have II grade teacher training with special vocational training to teach the deaf. I once had a student with profound deafness. At the end of the term I gave her an audibility test, reading up to 120 lines, and it was just brilliant to see her response. Today she is in a mainstream school.', 'The words of the teachers there showed the interest and dedication they had towards the children and it seemed like they would go one mile ahead to make sure their children perform better at whatever they chose to do.', 'Also the parents, especially homemaker mothers, come there out of their own will helping and engaging themselves in the noble cause. For an outsider it looks like a perfect environment for a child to learn, grow and live.', 'As I was speaking to a few girls of standard I, I found them very excited to tell me their experience. They shared their artwork, a girl of II standard showed me her sketches, and all the girls in the class showed me their project on EVS.', 'The teacher to student ratio is quite small, in comparison to other schools. For most classes it is around 5-10 students for every one teacher. The school is very keen on organizing cultural and sport festivals, with distinguished and honorary guests every year, in order to inspire the young children.', 'All in all, Little Flower School has created a holistic environment for the development of deaf children. Not just for the purpose of education, but for overall growth as individuals to achieve their goals and dreams.', 'It is important for the school to have a website, and they are looking out for consultants or support to help them build one. It will give them access to a larger group of people who need such a facility. The school also provides hostel facility for out-of-city students.
