Theirs is a solution that incorporates tradition as well as knowledge of farming and it has been in practice for decades now.', 'Generally, the flood-ravaged districts of eastern Bihar present a scenario of abject poverty and poor development. But Dharhara is an exception. Located about 20 kilometres from the district headquarters of Bhagalpur, this village is one of the greenest pockets of the region. And that’s not all. Unlike elsewhere, for years now girls in this village have been welcomed into the world in the most novel way: By the local community planting at least 10 fruit trees – traditionally mango – in celebration. New daughters here are treated as avatars of Goddess Lakshmi and stand to inherit these fruit trees as they grow up.', 'Owing to the tradition, this green village – which is surrounded by the river Ganga to the south and the unpredictable river Kosi to the north-east – is today nestled in the midst of more than 20,000 fruit-bearing trees. Sukriti, the young daughter of the village pradhan, Parmanand Singh, says, “Even as the world is frantically discussing how to deal with issues like sex selective abortions, global warming and the carbon footprint, planting trees when girls are born is our simple solution to all these complicated problems.”', 'In the highly prejudiced Bihari society, where girls are generally seen as a financial ‘bojh’ (burden) on the family, dowry deaths that were once so common here no longer make the news. Planting trees to celebrate the birth of a girl child is essentially a move to build an asset base for her, which can eventually be utilised by the family to finance her education and future development. Former pradhan, Pramod Singh, puts it this way,', 'She inherits the trees and over the years the fruit not only helps support her family it also helps them bear the expenses of her wedding. We plant the trees at birth because as our girls grow up, so do the trees.', 'Pramod had planted 10 mango trees about 12 years ago when his daughter, Niti, was born. Niti now goes to school and neither her father nor other family members consider her school fees a burden since the money comes from selling the fruit from her trees. Of course her very traditional mother, Rita Devi, has taken to planning for her marriage already and sees Niti’s trees as an asset in that context.', 'The unfortunate social practice of dowry may take many more years, or even generations, to overcome, but Madhurani, 20, who got married a couple of years back and is a proud mother of a three-month-old daughter, chooses to be optimistic, “Of course we know we cannot completely remove the practice of dowry from our social system, but at least having some assets in their name have given our girls and their families a better life.”', 'Adds Gul Afsan, an activist with the NGO, ‘Her Initiative’, which works for the empowerment of poor women through entrepreneurship, “Although the purpose of planting these trees is to build an asset for the future of local girls, it has also helped them develop a sense of ownership – rare among women of this region.”', 'For now, the 8,000 villagers of Dharhara, including scores of young girls, are enjoying the fruits of their labour. In Bhagalpur, a district well-known for mangoes, a tree takes around four to five years to mature and then, with some care, they start yielding bumper crops every season. While the greater part of the produce is sold, some of it is kept aside for the children to enjoy. Says Nirmala Devi, a mother of three, “My daughters love to eat mangoes and I don’t stop them since it’s good for their health.”', 'Planting mango is also profitable because once the trees become old they can be felled for wood, which is in great demand in the low-cost furniture market. “We cut the trees over a period of several years for the wood and all the furniture that is customarily presented to girls during marriage is made from this,” adds Nirmala.', 'Nivedita Singh, 20, who recently got married to a schoolteacher working in a nearby village, explains, “Another reason for this trend is that the amount of labour needed to work in orchards is much less. One only needs to be patient for a few initial years and then it only gets better.” Her parents, too, did not have to worry about money for her education or marriage, as her trees were there to support them.', 'These trees have also impacted cultivation patterns in this region. Notes Parmanand Singh, “People in our village have been tilling land as a means of livelihood for generations. But, of late, there has been a shift from conventional farming to fruit tree plantation, as it pays better.”', 'While the mango is still the preferred tree for fruit plantation, it’s not always easy to maintain and sometimes they are not cost-effective either. Therefore, many farmers here are now opting for guavas, litchis and papayas since they are cheaper to grow and take less time to mature.', 'Shatrughan Singh, an octogenarian, has planted more than 600 trees in Dharhara for his daughters, granddaughters and other village girls. Most of his trees are mango, but even he has taken to planting litchis over the past few years. His daughters are now married, and his two granddaughters, Neha and Nisha, go to school. Both the girls are excited at the prospect of owning 20 trees among them once they grow up.', 'Trees for girls is an innovative practice and one that can potentially check the decline in Bihar’s child sex ratio, if the idea catches on in other parts of the state. According to the 2011 Census, at 933, the state’s child sex ratio may be better than the national average of 914, but it has dropped sharply from the figure of 981 that the state had registered 30 years ago.', 'The success story of Dharhara has even caught the attention of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who has visited the village to plant trees and ensure that a girls’ school is built there. During a public meeting in the village, some years ago, he said that the Dharhara residents’ age-old practice of planting trees to mark the birth of girl child is worth emulating at a time when the gender ratio in the country has been on the decline. He added that local people have, in their own novel way, addressed two concerns with this one move: Environmental conservation and gender justice.', 'Treat the girl child as a blessing and trees as bank deposits – that’s the message from this tiny village.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
1,2012-8,"['Archives', 'i-Probono: Where Lawyers Can Offer Free Legal Assistance To NGOs']","['\n\n\nby\n\nAnuradha Parekh\n\n\nAugust 28, 2012, 10:28 am \n\n\n', '“Pro bono” is not just a term found in John Grisham’s books. It is a thriving culture among legal fraternities of many developed nations, where lawyers, law students and law firms go out of their way to provide legal assistance to people and organizations who are in need of but cannot afford to pay for their services. This practice is not as widespread in the Indian law community at present, but a networking website and the team behind it is trying to change that very fast.', 'When India Vision Foundation (IVF), an NGO set up by Kiran Bedi for prison and police reform, needed assistance in drafting a Memorandum of Understanding for legal purposes, they did not know whom to ask for help. Legal services are an expensive proposition, and besides, it can also be challenging to find a reliable professional or firm. After some searching, they approached i-Probono with their requirements, who matched IVF’s project with an in-house lawyer at a multi-national corporation in Bangalore. The lawyer also drafted a standard form MoU for IVF’s future use. The project helped IVF professionalize and expand its work.', 'This is just one of the many Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) aided by i-Probono in accessing free legal assistance. i-Probono is a not-for-profit online portal which was started 3 years ago, with the purpose of connecting social sector projects and organizations with lawyers and law firms who wish to volunteer their services for a social cause.', 'The global outreach of i-Probono allows lawyers and law students to undertake projects from around the world and allows NGOs and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) access to legal assistance across jurisdictions. The website takes care to match lawyers specifically to projects which utilise their expertise in causes they believe in. In addition, i-Probono acts as a capacity builder to CSOs by allowing them to scale up their work, take pre-emptory steps to comply with the law and galvanize human rights advocacy.', 'Although established in London, i-Probono always had a deep connection with India as Shireen Irani, the Founder and Executive Director, has roots in Mumbai and has worked and studied in the country. With a vision to integrating pro bono work culture into mainstream India and engaging lawyers in the work of civil society, Shireen believes that pro bono culture is here to stay, and the many changes around us, including the spurt in internet networking, is just going to facilitate and spread this movement.', 'I started i-Probono on the back of my own experience. As a lawyer, I and many of my colleagues wanted to give back but there was no easy way to find opportunities that fit our interests and expertise. When I had previously worked with NGOs I knew they struggled to find the right legal help, even when they could pay for it. By 2008 online networks had come of age; we were using the internet for everything – finding friends, business contacts, shopping – that’s when I first thought of harnessing the web to connect lawyers to NGOs.', 'The use of i-Probono website is free and simple. An organization can log on to www.i-probono.com, register and put up its legal requirements. The proactive team at i-Probono will then scout for lawyers whose legal expertise best fits the requirements, and connect with the two. The NGO can decide on which professional they wish to work with, and take it forward from there. There is a similar procedure for lawyers and law students, where they can register and fill in their expertise and interests so that a suitable project can be found for them.', 'Swathi Sukumar, India Country Director of i-Probono, has been working relentlessly for over a year to convert mindsets in the legal circles in India, and is most familiar the Indian scenario. She admits that it is a challenge convincing Indian law firms to accept the pro bono concept, but is optimistic that it is slowly but surely taking root in the country, as more and more lawyers wish to be a part of the change taking place all around them.', 'The response to i-Probono has been uniformly positive and enthusiastic in both the NGO and the legal communities in India. However, there are challenges that we face that are peculiar to India. The first challenge is that the Indian legal community, especially within law firms, does not have a pro bono culture. While pro bono work is undertaken on an ad hoc basis by lawyers, it is not systematized. To address this issue, i-Probono is working with law firms and lawyers to develop individualized pro bono programs that suit the capacity, expertise and nature of each firm and law practice.', 'Secondly, factors such as the size of the country and the sheer diversity in NGOs, lawyers and local legal requirements pose a daunting challenge to our work. Several NGOs cannot access our network because they are in underserved areas, including in rural areas. We are looking at gradually expanding our operations to places other than the metro cities.', 'While Shireen and her team dream of spreading the pro bono work culture around the world, they have decided to focus on India at the moment despite the many challenges faced. “We’re working one country at a time. It’s essential to understand the legal market and civil society sector for different jurisdictions but that’s a huge task and many countries already have an evolved system of pro bono work. We want to concentrate our energies where we can add value which is why we’re focusing on India,” says Shireen.', 'The dogged perseverance with which Shireen and Swathi have been evangelizing i-Probono in India has convinced them that the legal community in India is waking up to the benefits of pro bono work. In an age of a million law firms and an estimated 60,000 law students joining the profession each year, it also acts as a differentiator. With clients getting more discerning, law firms getting more progressive and law students and professionals getting more involved in the positive changes around them, the future of pro bono work in India certainly looks promising.\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
2,2012-8,"['Archives', 'TBI Experiences: Lessons of A Lifetime – Spending Three Weeks With Disadvantaged Girls']","['\n\n\nby\n\nSonakshi Kandhari\n\n\nAugust 24, 2012, 10:44 am \n\n\n', 'Not many among us take out the time to help or work with under-privileged or distressed communities, though we very often think about it. But when we do, the learning is enormous and remains with us for the rest of our lives. Sonakshi Kandhari re-lives the few weeks she spent with street girls in a shelter in Bangalore, and shares her experience with us.', 'Family is a social unit that usually comprises of a set of parents and children, in addition to other members like grandparents, aunts, uncles, and more. It is a safe haven that gives one the emotional strength to withstand the bad times and love that nurtures them to be happy in life. But sometimes the fabric of the family is too thin to support the children, and they have to be taken care of by other kind people. An initiative has been started to help such under-privileged families by the Good Shepherd Congregation which works with young girls and women in distress. They have set up an NGO in Bangalore called Chaithanya.', 'Chaithanya works towards protecting girls on the street who have been in disadvantaged families or those who have faced the brunt of an abusive family member. It provides residential facilities and vocational training that gives them a direction in life and prevents them from succumbing to means that would cause them harm.', 'Chaithanya has two programmes. One of them is called “Home Of Love” in which they have the facility to accommodate twenty-five girls. They provide them with day-to-day necessities like food, clothing, shelter, non-formal education and various activities like dancing, painting, karate etc.', 'They also engage in vocational training programme where in they teach the girls skills like tailoring, cooking, knitting and crochet which is of great help to them all through life. These classes are conducted by volunteers from Ladies of Charity, a voluntary group from St Patrick’s Church Bangalore.', 'Chaithanya goes a step further – they not only train the children but they also help them by arranging for group sessions that are educational and recreational in nature like picnics. They keep in touch with the parents and inform them about the progress of their child and encourage them to meet her frequently.', 'I had the opportunity to work there for a duration of three weeks which gave me a chance to interact with the kids and understand how the organization works. They have a schedule which gives them time for a few fun activities with a strict adherence to rules and regulations.', 'I learnt a lot from the kids while working with them. They know how to be happy with the smallest of things. Their willingness to learn made it evident that they are eager to make something out of their lives. Few of the girls were angry because of the problems life had thrown their way but they still managed to carry on with a smile on their face.', 'I was volunteering there along with my friends, and we spent three days a week helping them with their studies and on Sunday we spent some time playing with them. The girls were divided according to their age and allocated to our care. I chose coaching the youngest lot. Teaching them was a pleasure.', 'We would spend an hour teaching them, from four to five in the evening, and after we left they would spend a little more time studying. They would then help the people in the organization and carry out their daily chores. While teaching them, we were guided by a member of the organization who would tell us what to do if we faced any problem.', 'Working there and spending time with the girls gave me an insight into their life and the problems they face. Young Lakshmi of six was compelled to leave her parents. Being the eldest of three sisters, she was sent to Chaithanya where she could reside and get her basic education. Unfortunately, she started believing that her parents had no love for her and this thought would leave her in tears very often. We used to talk to her very often and convince her that this was not the case, and it was only because of her family’s financial condition that she had been sent away, and that it was for her own good that her parents had done this.', 'During our free time when we used to play and interact with them, we got to observe their hidden talents. 15-year old Reshma is gifted with a very melodious voice and aspired to be a part of the popular reality show Indian Idol.', 'The girls who had an aptitude for studying had more ambitious dreams. There were a couple of girls who wanted to know how they could get work in a big company. We explained to them about courses like B.COM and BBM and gave them a brief overview of what they comprised of and how they could apply.', 'They expressed their gratitude to us in many ways but the most special was by making us a part of their close-knit group. The girls used to refer to me and my friends as “Aka”, which means sister in Kannada.', 'While we are leading our comfortable lives and getting busy with hectic schedules, we often fail to realise how blessed we are. Going there made me realize that removing a little time for under-privileged kids gives them a lot of happiness. Chaithanya- a Project for Street Girls is just one of many NGOs that we can volunteer with and make a difference in someone’s life.', 'Chaithanya is situated at Museum road, Bangalore-560 025 Karnataka, India.\nContact Number: +91 80 22383564\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
3,2012-8,"['Archives', 'TBI Heroes: Jyotsna Sitling – A Green Warrior']","['\n\n\nby\n\nRanjini Sivaswamy\n\n\nAugust 22, 2012, 10:37 am \n\n\n', 'An entire mountain region would have been left to deteriorate into a plastic garbage dump. A National Park would have been shamefully left to a degenerate, unable to gain the recognition worth its value. A hill range would have lost an unbelievable amount of soil cover and destroyed the livelihood of thousands of people. All this if Jyotsna Sitling had not done some of the most admirable jobs in public service!', 'She’s India’s first female tribal IFS officer, genuinely passionate about the environment, who has carried her spirit for work over the years to become the recipient of the paramount honour for environment conservation in India – the Indira Gandhi Paryavaran Puraskar. Not many would have expected Jyotsna, hailing from a nondescript village in Bengal, to move the mountains. And she indeed did move the range of Himalayas in Uttarakhand away from the course its fate was fast running into.', 'It was back in 2002 that Jyotsna joined the Nanda Devi Biosphere in Uttarakhand, as its Director. 5800 acres of land to manage, with two national parks and a sanctuary to revive, and closely intertwined livelihood of people – a short and sweet Jyotsna saw challenges hurled at her in abundance. She had the toughest of jobs in the most beautiful of lands.', 'The Valley of Flowers National Park, an unmatched landscape with the rarest of flora and fauna, hosts a buffer zone with a 19-km trail that leads to Hemkund Sahib, the highest Gurdwara in the world. The breath-taking trail was literally breath-taking, stinking as it was, with plastic and other dumps that the pilgrims left behind remorselessly for three decades. Jyotsna decided to start vigorous campaigns by involving the local community. She called for a garbage collection initiative by the community and to her surprise they collected 15 truckloads of garbage weighing up to 50 tonnes! The entire mass was sent for recycling and the valley started getting rid of its pollutants.', 'Now redemption for the past mistakes was achieved, but sustaining this achievement for the future needed some more things to change. The next task was to regulate the 400 odd unorganized shops that massively contributed to polluting the trek trail to the Gurdwara. But the shops couldn’t be ruthlessly removed. And environment conservation is not the easiest of things to speak about when livelihoods are at stake. Adding to it, the forest officials and the local community were not on the best terms. So there Jyotsna was – with the tasks of bridging the animosity to build a relationship with the people, working out the reversal of the damage done to the environment and helping develop the quality of lives of the people.', 'Jyotsna studied the issue with putting both the environmental conservation and the livelihood of the people at equal priority. And when she combined both, the result was economic gain for the people and conscious and sustainable conservation for the environment.', 'She sat down with the shop owners for convincing them to reduce the number of shops to one per family. She explained that their incomes were getting grossly divided and the environment was also suffering. She literally spent six to seven continuous days and nights to explain, convince and take people into confidence to finally agree to her plan. There was tremendous difficulty in deciding who gets which land. But at the end of it all, the number of shops came down from 400 to 76 – a huge relief for the Valley of Flowers, and people were happy to see that Jyotsna’s idea worked well for them. Notably, Jyotsna was successful in making the hostility between the forest officials and the people fade away.', 'Jyotsna put in many checks so that what was achieved was not lost in the years to come. She put the systems into place for responsible tourism through an Eco Development Committee (EDC) of the local stakeholder villagers. The Eco fee that she introduced helped in bringing funds for cleaning operations and for building systems on green value chain for services to the pilgrims without depending on government funds. She worked out insurance policies for the pilgrims. This generated a continuous influx of money for the sustenance and development of the region. Many small businesses for the service of pilgrims, like renting plastic coats, were introduced such that more income-generating opportunities were created thus linking livelihood concerns of locals with the conservation realities of the area.', 'Jyotsna distilled her experience on the effect of mountaineering activity on the environment during her tenure as Director, Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (2002 to 2004) and put together an entire guideline for mountaineering in Uttarakhand in 2004. This guideline is first of its kind in any state in India. She says it’s all about making the markets work for environment and making the community the real stakeholders.', 'Concurrently, she also carried out many other activities to rejuvenate the face of the Valley of Flowers National Park. The crowning glory came when all these efforts led to the declaration of the Park as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2005.', 'Another of Jyotsna’s major initiatives between 1997 and 2000 was in the erosion-prone zone of the Shivalik range near the Doon Valley. She mobilized a community of nearly eleven thousand people across 82 villages to spend at least 1 day in a year for the restoration of their villages. Together they planted 3,82,000 plants and sowed over 70 kgs of seeds of various plant species, saving the fate of the villages that lay close to 358 strategic erosion-prone locations. What could be said about the impact of this incredible act of service?', 'She’s done some of the most incredible works ever for the environment in our country. But she’s not the one who’d take her successes to her head. She’s a powerhouse of unstoppable energy who constantly traverses that extra mile to do extraordinary work. Jyotsna, an alumna of IIM Bangalore, today is the Project Director of Livelihoods Improvement Project for the Himalayas, Uttarakhand. She is 49 and chose to stay single. She has adopted the family of her caretaker maid. The family lives with her and Jyotsna takes great interest in the education of their son.', 'Last year Jyotsna met with an accident causing her head injuries that left her with 16 stitches and many months for recovery.

7,2012-8,"['Archives', 'This Independence Day, Say Thank You To Our Soldiers!']","['\n\n\nby\n\nPalak Bhatia\n\n\nAugust 13, 2012, 10:31 am \n\n\n', 'Independence Day is an occasion to celebrate one’s homeland, patriotism and of course, freedom. Each individual has its own way to go about it; the Prime Minister hoists the Tri-color at the Red Fort, there are programmes held in schools, the national anthem is sung at various corners of the country… but for most of us, the occasion holds little significance other than a holiday. However, it is essential that we utilize this day to remember the struggles of our ancestors and appreciate the freedom that we have taken for granted.', '21fools.com has come up with an innovative way to give Independence Day an all new meaning. They have introduced an initiative wherein we, the citizens of India, can celebrate our freedoms by sending a token of our gratitude to the people who are responsible for gifting us with restful and peaceful lives. Our very own soldiers. They have allowed us an opportunity to participate in their initiative of gifting our soldiers with cards this Independence day. For there is nothing more touching to those brave men than our appreciation and gratefulness for the tough lives they lead while protecting us.', 'The procedure is simple enough:\nStep 1: The customer will come and purchase the greeting card from the website www.21fools.com\nStep 2: 21fools will print the card and send it equally to all the five Indian Army Border HQ. (Udhampur, Pune, Kolkata, Jaipur, Lucknow)\nStep 3: The name of the people who have bought the card will be displayed on www.21fools.com\nStep 4: The details (Signed letter from the Indian Army that ‘X’ number of greeting card have been received by them) will be made public via 21fools.', 'The cards will be printed in Mumbai. From here they will be shipped in bulk to the five different Army Headquarters all over India and the Army will send the cards from these HQ to the remote border areas.', 'Because of security reasons, it is not possible to reveal the name of the soldier to whom the card will reach. But in order to make the process more informative for the customers, 21fools will send a Thank you card to the person who has taken part in the initiative and will let him/her know to which part of India the card has been shipped.', 'The start-up has already obtained the necessary approvals from the Indian Army to implement this great idea and is receiving help from them in sending the Thank you greeting card to the soldiers on the border. The Design for the greeting card is complete and is unique in terms of the number of people who have aided in creating it. The design includes 28 pictures of 28 different people from all the states, symbolising the collective greetings from all the states.', 'It is good to learn that 21fools has introduced this gesture for the noble cause of bringing a smile on a soldier’s face, rather than for monetary gains. In fact, the sole motive of the start-up is to make this world a happier place. According to them, whatever they are charging the customers for the cards will be completely used for the printing, creasing, cutting, packaging and shipping of the cards. If at all there is a margin of profit, they intend to use it to print more cards for our soldiers and send it on behalf of all the people who have bought it. In order to keep the initiative out of any controversies, they will make the finances as transparent as possible on their website.', 'Though the response from the start-up community and the media has been highly positive to the venture, the number of cards sold until now is not very satisfying. Mails from the Indian Army say that they are really looking forward to this initiative and 21fools has placed its trust in the people of India to not disappoint the soldiers. It is my humble request that all of you set aside a little of your allowance to participate in this exquisite initiative and make our soldiers feel like the prized heroes they are. Ask your organization, your school, your college or the company in which you are working to participate in the initiative and make it big. Let us thank the soldiers for being away from their homes, spending uncomfortable days and nights, and living in the harsh terrains… all for our safety.\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Murugayee and her family of nine had to depend on the public water supply in her village, where they had to stand in long queues and brave fights till she could get a loan to build a water system in her home. These are just two of the many people Milaap has helped through their innovative micro-finance program for addressing daily needs.', '“People usually lend a loan against something of value – a guarantee of sorts. This is so much better,” says Murugayee Raju about Milaap, an online micro-lending platform that turned her life around after a gruesome fight for drinking water', 'Clad in her tattered cottons, Murugayee Raju looks up at the camera – resplendent, her smile and poised stature reiterating that she doesn’t intend to pose. That despite being fifty-four, working at construction sites and running a house of nine, she is genuinely happy. Ask for her secret and she gradually unravels the nightmare that was her life a few months ago and how it all changed.', 'In a small house in Musiri, a village near Trichy, Murugayee has been living with her husband, three sons, their two wives (one died) and three grandchildren. Apart from doing odd jobs in construction, Murugayee makes mats, and is a cleaner at a school nearby. Life had always meant hardships. “Eleven days after giving birth, I was back at a farm, chopping firewood,” says Murugayee with a smile, which soon fades as she narrates her story. “For a long time, we relied on public water supply and the local bore well to run the house,” she recalls and explains how the bore well water was very salty and required a lot of pumping. Hence her husband and she queued up at public water supplies every time. But the supply lasted exactly for an hour, as a result of which they would have to drop whatever they were doing at the time to go fill water. If they were working or tending to cattle, they would end up missing the supply.', 'However, landing up on time to fetch water wasn’t always an advantage. Sometimes, horrible fights broke out and depending on the local policemen every time was not working, she tells us. One day, a fight got quite out of hand and a heavy blow landed Murugayee in the hospital with a deep gash in her head and her husband with an injured nose and broken teeth. The couple ended up spending over Rs 10,000 on medical expenses.', 'Murugayee decided not to endure more and with the help of Gramalaya Urban And Rural Development Initiatives And Network (GUARDIAN), a microfinance institution, she got in touch with Milaap, a social enterprise and online micro-lending platform that enables people to provide loans to others for basic necessities like sanitation, education etc. With Milaap’s assistance and a loan, Murugayee’s family was able to install a piped water connection at home. Now she fills up 30 water-pots at a time and sometimes when she has filled her share, she lends water to her neighbours.', 'You wonder why a woman as benevolent as Murugayee would suffer so much before asking for help. This is exactly the dilemma that plagues many. For some, pride comes in the way and for others it’s a kind of complacency, a defeatist habit of yielding to their own situation, a fear that they are inherently incapable of returning a favour, of repaying a loan. Here’s another heart-wrenching story of a man in need. Though not physical, his ordeal was also a long and arduous one.', 'Parameswaran lives in Trichy with his wife, an 11-year-old son and a 13-year-old daughter. He works in the field of construction and earns approximately Rs. 4500 per month. This family of small means had no toilets in their house. Hence the women in the house had to rush to the fields to relieve themselves. If that was not possible then they would actually wait for it to get dark, in order to get some kind of privacy. And that’s not all. While Parameswaran’s wife Ramalakshmi didn’t have to depend on another for a need as fundamental as this, his daughter, who suffers from a physical disability, had to be carried to the fields each time she wanted to relieve herself.', 'Naturally, it was getting increasingly strenuous for Parameswaran to do this task every single time, more so as his daughter began growing older. Moreover, both for the father as well as the daughter it was socially embarrassing, especially for a girl stepping into adolescence. Sure enough, the practice also started taking a toll on basic hygiene at home. Parameswaran’s son suffered a debilitating bout of diarrhoea and that proved to be the turning point for Parameswaran; his wife and he decided it was high time they built a toilet at home. Here is a video of Parameswaran telling the story of how the loan helped change his life for the better. (If you cannot view the video below, you can also watch it on Youtube.)', 'Acquiring a loan for this purpose was easy with the help of Milaap, as repaying it in monthly installments was not difficult. Also, an added advantage was that the loan interest rates at Milaap were low. Parameswaran’s example has inevitably inspired many of his neighbours to take the help of Milaap for building toilets in their homes. Parameswaran, as is evident in the photograph, is a happy man today and more importantly, a father finally rid of an immense sense of guilt for not having provided for his daughter.', 'For the upcoming Independence Day, Milaap has launched their ‘Adopt an entrepreneur’ campaign, seeking to get 30 micro-entrepreneurs fully funded by August 15th. Each of the entrepreneurs require Rs 35,000 (625 USD) to set up or expand small businesses.

9,2012-8,"['Archives', 'TBI THIS-Ability: Pradip Sinha – Ready To Touch A New High']","['Malay Desai visits the Helen Keller Institute for Deaf and Deafblind in Mumbai, and meets one of the students. Pradip joined the centre at the age of 12, a scared and confused child. Today, at the age of 33, he is confident of making his life decisions and is looking forward to starting his own business. It is truly remarkable what the right environment and supportive people can help you achieve.', '‘Chhoone se phailta hai toh sirf pyar’, actor Shabana Azmi had informed all Indians in an AIDS awareness TV spot in the 90s. So radical was that line that we couldn’t help recalling it as we entered a small room with a loft on the ground floor of a municipal school in south Mumbai. Frankly, we’d expected the Helen Keller Institute for Deaf and Deaf blind (HKIDB), a pioneering body in Asia for its work for deaf blindness, to be grander. But minutes into a ‘conversation’ with one of its students Pradip Sinha, we realised its grandeur. After all, we were using both our hands to clasp his in various ways to communicate and unravel an outstanding life story.', '‘Deafblind’ is one word, a term used to describe the deaf who lost sight or vice versa. Most of us won’t at first recall the name of this institute’s namesake as a revolutionary deafblind person, but would get perspective at the mention of Rani Mukherjee’s character in the film Black. We spot a forlorn postcard of the film too, while ‘talking’ to Pradip. He is using the American Sign Language (ASL) to talk and feeling his teacher and interpreter Devyani Hadkar’s palms to ‘listen’. Their hand movements are too swift for us, and often end prematurely as one understands the other beforehand, and we only reason this sync to years of their time spent in this room.', '“As a child, I was confused and scared,” Pradip is hesitant as he tells us of his past, but his face is ever-beaming. The only brother to five sisters in a middle-class Kolkata family, he was born deaf with Rubella Syndrome (group of abnormalities that occur to a developing foetus) but lost vision only at age 10. “His protective parents wouldn’t let him out too much until his sisters discovered our centre in 1991 and sent him to Mumbai,” Devyani tells us. She doesn’t need to refer to him on many things we ask – his past, present, even about his feelings. Devyani is the doting figure that has anchored Pradip to this city.', 'This also means that Pradip’s sisters, who’re incidentally visiting him when we’re there, don’t know him as well as Devyani does. “Mujhe itna nahi aata (I don’t know that much),” one of them admits of the ASL. Pradip was brought here when he was nine, and like in cases of many deaf blinds, this created some distance with his blood relatives. Even though he goes home every year like any other out-of-towner in Mumbai, the overall lack of communication has created a perplexed wall between them. “In fact, he just didn’t go last year because he ‘didn’t feel like’,” Devyani adds. She is therefore, playing the bridge between him and his family.', 'Another element that has held Pradip together in his different youth so far has been religion, and we discover this only when he tells us his email id, which has ‘Philip’ in it. “My priest gave it to me,” he says. “Why did you convert?” we ask. Devyani is curious too. Pradip makes random signs till we figure he’s just mumbling and suddenly the smile we thought was perennial turns into a nervous, straight face. “My family did not trust me in many things. So I decided for myself in 1996 to be happy,” he opens up on email later. Devyani, however believes that witnessing the Hindu-Muslim riots of 1993 may be the reason. The ‘Philip’ within ‘Pradip’ is still a mystery to us, especially when Devyani tells us of his staunch ways of not even having ‘Prasad’.', 'That said, Pradip is still just another man in the big city, living on rent with a roomie Akhtar (also deafblind), travelling 90 minutes by train every day, chasing dreams of becoming a businessman. The time that he flies out of his nest is near, he knows it; Devyani knows it. “I’m ready to stay wherever my work takes me. I might need to be with my mother as I’m the only son!” he asserts. After he finishes his Diploma for Computer Education for the Deafblind, he would like to become a trainer for other deafblind persons, and utilise his proficiency with special computers. The woman interpreting his thoughts to us now is a key player, and has in fact called the sisters here to give them a subtle ‘it-is-time-he-must-go’ message.', 'The question of long-term companionship is lurking too. Pradip is 33 and though he doesn’t reveal much on the subject, Devyani reports that along with his roommate and friends, he’s been excitedly talking on this and scouting for matches – disabled or otherwise. “Some of them have been hitched to sighted partners… their optimism is high!” she smiles.', 'An hour or so of this warm, three-way talk later, Pradip takes our palm and doodles an invisible ‘Nice to meet you’ with his index finger. As we envelope his hand in both ours and pat him, we realise Shabana Azmi was indeed right.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
10,2012-8,"['Written by Gangadharan Menon', 'TBI Wildlife: Bondla Sanctuary In Goa – A Bird Watcher’s Paradise']","['\n\n\nby\n\nGangadharan Menon\n\n\nAugust 6, 2012, 9:00 am \n\n\n', 'There is a lot more to Goa than the sun and sand, discovers Gangadharan Menon on a recent visit there. Not only did he meet with a large diversity of flora and fauna, he also met a forest ranger who impressed him with his knowledge about the various species and his dedication towards conserving them.', 'Goa is known for three things. Beaches, beaches and beaches. But of late, it’s being discovered that it also has forests. In fact, there are as many as 750 square kilometres of protected forests, spread across 6 sanctuaries in the tiny state of Goa: Bondla, Mhadei, Mollem, Netravali, Cotigao and Chorao.', 'Like Kerala, Goa is a strip of land sandwiched between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats, where swaying coconut palms slowly transform themselves into dense evergreen forests.', 'Of all the sanctuaries in Goa, the one at Bondla is the friendliest.', 'There are many reasons for this: It’s a teenie-weenie sanctuary of just 8 square kilometres; so the size is not intimidating. Though it’s an outcrop of the Western Ghats, it is isolated from it. In fact, it’s an island of hillocks surrounded by valleys on all eight sides. So the lost feeling of being in an endless forest isn’t there. Since it’s a moist, deciduous forest, the vegetation is sparse; hence it’s easier to spot a wild animal lurking in the bushes. Another reason could be the sights and sounds that welcome you in Bondla: an innumerable number of butterflies and birds that make it point to perch on the trees near the road, and not play hide and seek in the yonder forest. Or is it the aesthetically designed cottages that merge so beautifully with the forest that make it a homely forest? Or is it the friendliness of the staff, starting with the affable Paresh Porob himself, that makes the forest itself so friendly? I really don’t know; and I really don’t want to know.', 'Bondla was once a hunter’s paradise. When the government took over, there were many departments that came to spoil the broth. The forest department was in charge of the forest, the tourism department was in charge of tourism, and the agriculture department was in charge of the chikkoo plantations. When Mr. Bandodkar, an erstwhile hunter-turned-conservationist took over as Chief Minister in 1969, he converged all these functions into one, and gave the complete charge to the Forest Department. Thus was born eco-tourism in Goa, much before the phrase was coined.', 'Goa is probably the only state where eco-tourism is managed so well by the Forest Department. And the sanctuary at Bondla is an example worth emulating by other states. The philosophy behind eco-tourism is interesting: To reduce poaching, increase tourism. The very presence of tourists, and the continuous movement of vehicles, will deter poachers who prefer to operate in forests that are not easily accessed.', 'To defend the forest and to safeguard the lives of the citizens of the forest, a new breed of bold and upright officers have been created. And unlike in other states where the officers have only a lathi to counter the armed poachers, here they have been powered with arms and empowered with decision-making. They are even given the license to engage in ‘hot pursuit’ of poachers, and are allowed to do their duty without political interference. Another striking aspect is the passion for conservation that the entire staff shares, and the knowledge they have about the flora and fauna of the forest they dwell in.', 'Our bus from Ponda dropped us at a nondescript place called Ganjem, where we were to be picked up by a forest jeep. We got down in the middle of nowhere, but the appointed jeep hadn’t reached. As we walked towards a road that seemed to lead into a forest, I was reminded of a similar incident in Sariska. There, without knowing the way, my wife Anita holding our 6-month old son Akash, and I lugging the luggage, had walked in the direction of the Sariska sanctuary, after being dropped in the middle of nowhere by a private bus. And there, at the very first turn, we had seen the bone-chilling sight of a kill on the roadside. Here, things were not that alarming, and soon enough the jeep came a-calling.', 'A walk in the forest revealed that Bondla is a birdwatcher’s paradise. All around us were birds of different feathers that had flocked together, creating a symphony of evening melodies. There were six flame-backed woodpeckers that came to roost in the hollow trunk of a bottle palm; the ruby-throated bulbul that announced itself as the State Bird of Goa; and a dozen hornbills that flew overhead and shook the treetops with the flapping of their gigantic wings. Little did we know that this was just the trailer of a 70mm feature film to follow.', 'Later, Paresh Porob, the Range Officer of Bondla who’s earned the sobriquet of ‘Ranger in Danger’ for his courageous stand against the jungle mafia, took us to his personal hideout from where he has taken many a wonderful photograph. Made with camouflaged cloth, it was erected right in front of a waterhole; and in his meditative moments Paresh would sit there, taking photographs of birds and bees and butterflies. Looking into his eyes, I wondered what he would have been if he wasn’t a forest officer. Maybe a commando for his courage and commitment; or maybe a wildlife photographer for his sense and sensibility.', 'In the late evening, he took us to his house and introduced us to the hatchling of a forest owlet that he had recently rescued. It gave us all a welcome peck, mistaking our fingers for food. Paresh told us how he gets up every three hours in the night to feed his baby; and that’s when we realised that an owl has its eyes wide shut in the day, and is wide awake in the night! This Zoo in the Carton was the miniature of the Bondla Zoo which started as a rescue shelter for the injured animals of Bondla sanctuary; but expanded to become a haven for animals rescued from forests all over Goa.', 'The next day we trekked to the watch tower for a bird’s eye view of the entire sanctuary. And on the way, we came across a beautiful nest made of moss from which an unidentified bird flew away, and sat on a faraway branch. Later it was identified as the red-throated flycatcher; and to our pleasant surprise we learnt that it was only the third time it has been sighted in Goa. As we climbed the Sidha hill we came across the only patch of semi-evergreen forest in Bondla, where we saw the Goan cousins of the Malabar Giant Squirrel.', 'When we descended to the zoo, we saw a heart-warming sight. A peacock outside the enclosure, and a peacock inside the enclosure. At first we thought the peacock outside had escaped from captivity; but soon we realised that it had flown in from the adjoining forest. My wife Anita had a beautiful take on this. She said that the peacock outside must have come to pass on the latest news from the forest to the injured peacock inside.', 'As we walked through the forest, we observed that every tree has a hierarchy. The smallest birds are on the lowest branches; the medium-sized ones occupy the middle branches; and the biggies are perched right on top. A nice little pecking order!', 'In the evening, as the pre-monsoon clouds gathered overhead, Paresh told us about the unknown perils of an erratic monsoon. If there’s a false monsoon ahead of the real one, a curious tragedy unfolds. When it rains, frogs that have been in a dormant state for months emerge from the netherworld, and as is their wont immediately get into the mating ritual. In due course, the eggs are laid but when they hatch, the false rains disappear as truly as they come. And the tadpoles die a slow death in the dried up pools.', 'There was another shocking fact that Paresh shared with us that made us change the way we look at proliferation of wildlife. When a large herd of spotted deer darted across the forest, Paresh told us that the scenario is grim. We wondered, why is Paresh lamenting instead of rejoicing at the spurt in numbers? The reasons were two: An increase in the number of spotted deer meant the number of predators is decreasing. And also that the number of the smaller species of deer, like the barking deer and the mouse deer, is decreasing. Simply because, the voracious eaters that they are, spotted deer polish off the entire forest floor, including the tiny plants that are the only source of food for these tiny, ground-hugging deer.', 'As we bid farewell to Paresh and drove to our next destination in Goa, we discovered that outside the protected forests there was an equal area of ‘unprotected’ forests where mining was going on in full swing. The soft, red soil from these open mines had flown off for miles and miles, and covered the treetops of many forests like a shroud. And I wondered if the gaping holes that dot the landscape today will turn out to be the graveyards of Goa tomorrow.', 'Thankfully, soon after I returned from Goa, I read the news that the Western Ghats has been declared a World Heritage Site for its rich bio-diversity. And the fabulous forests of Goa can now breathe a lot easier.', 'Gangadharan Menon is a nature writer, art teacher, and photographer of the wild.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

They have done us proud by upholding the cultural values of our nation, and their dedication to the cause is admirable, as Palak Bhatia finds out on meeting them.', 'India is decidedly a country that is known for its hospitality all around the globe. ‘Atithi devoh bhavah’ (the guest is God) is a concept deeply rooted within our culture and for generations, we have strived to consider our guests as divine. This exquisite feeling shines through the efforts of the members of SIFE IIT Delhi, a student arm of the international organization SIFE, which is working towards creating sustainable economic opportunities for the needy.', 'Burma has been facing political and armed conflict between the military regime, political opponents, and ethnic groups that has resulted in the displacement of over 3.5 million people. Being an immediate neighbor, India has become home to a large portion of this displaced population. In fact, nearly 10,000 refugees reside in West Delhi today, something that a major portion of the citizens are unaware of. The uncountable challenges plaguing these people every day are quite overwhelming. Lack of legal protection, lack of work permits, discrimination, lack of education, abject living conditions, poor health conditions – unite this with the discomfort of being away from their homelands and familiar landscapes.', 'SIFE IIT Delhi, a student body of 26 members at IIT Delhi, has dedicated itself to the upliftment of these refugees and is helping them to gain a foothold in society. Their association with these people since November 2010 has enabled the students to appreciate the constant struggles they face and to develop a heartfelt relationship with them. Meeting a SIFE member is quite an eye-opener; their true commitment to the Burmese refugees’ cause is apparent immediately. They have brought forth Project Aarambh, a venture to initiate the refugees in the economic sphere and enable them to develop sustainable means of income using their current skills.', 'Weaving Hope is a venture that promotes the handicraft and weaving talents of the community. Due to a lack of knowledge of market scenarios, consumer demand, language barrier and societal exclusion, their skills have been unrecognized until now and SIFE IITD is striving hard to bring their talents to public light and create a market for the products. These goods, which boast of original Burmese culture, are created by women units within their community and marketed by the students. They organize corporate stalls to facilitate the sales of these handbags, laptop bags, purses, woolens, coats, and shawls. They have even sought professional support for improving skills, operations and scalability by collaborating with DASTKAR, a national organization, for the same.', 'Placement Cell is another arm that works towards providing a platform for the people looking for a job. The cell works as a two-way forum, an interface between the people and the factories and shops which have job vacancies. It ensures that the refugees get a just and sustainable pay for their services, while the employers get sincerity and hard work in return. They also conduct training sessions and workshops for them to improve their skills, find the right job and blend into the new work culture of today.', 'Food Project is yet another effort to provide them with a means of employment. Burmese dishes are unique in flavor and creation. Realizing that their only customers were the community members, SIFE realized that bringing their local cuisine into the open had a huge potential for creating sustainable enterprises. Through their food project, SIFE IITD has been organizing Burmese food stalls and catering opportunities in order to impart the essential exposure to their culinary skills, along with the much needed income to the cooks.', 'SIFE IITD also tries to forward their cause during Rendezvous, their annual college fest, when thousands of IITians and visitors get a chance to try out the Burmese dishes and handicrafts in an exclusive stall. Having tested some of their delicacies myself during the last year’s fest and witnessing the enormous success of their efforts, I could not help remarking upon the toils of the enthusiastic members, who happily invite visitors and treat the refugees with respect and love. Many college outreach programs such as the one in St. Stephen’s College and community initiatives such as Health Camps have also been organized.', 'But the most important objective of all is to enable the refugees to blend into the Indian society and sensitize the Indian community to welcome them with open arms. They are aware of the political, social and cultural dilemmas in helping a foreign refugee community – and their efforts are only meant to make the lives of these refugees a little more humane and meaningful. I salute the spirit of the SIFE IITD members, as well as the Burmese refugees, who are working hard to make their place in the world.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
