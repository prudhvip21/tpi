But their journey was not an easy one.', 'Did you know that each year, an average Mumbaiite emits 3.83 tonnes of carbon dioxide, which is the same as the emissions from a small petrol car making 76 round trips between Mumbai and Pune (a distance of 165km)? While our individual carbon footprints deserve some deliberation, the least we can do is think and buy everyday-products judiciously. A few bright minds have initiated the process.', 'Chirag Alreja, founder and owner of Hitplay, a mumbai-based gizmo start-up that sells gadgets and other products, has introduced a new range of bio-degradable and organic creations that are environment friendly. “Our sunflower bookmarks, fold-and-play recycled speakers, twig pencil and pens, water powered calculators, bird feeders etc help you make a healthy decision for yourself and the Earth,” says Alreja.', 'When asked about the decision to launch this range of products, pat comes Alreja’s reply, “At a hospital in the U.S some time ago, I was offered a paper bag that was bio-degradable. That got me thinking.” With one product designer on board, Alreja crowd-sourced some of the other designs and with the help of a suitable manufacturer, created a range of biodegradable products.', 'The Hitplay range boasts of a unique bookmark that has sunflower seeds embedded in it. “After use, this bookmark can be planted and with time it flowers;” smiles Alreja, “The bookmarks are suited to most climates and are handmade from recycled, biodegradable fibers. They must be sown in 1/8-inch-deep fine soil. You may plant it indoors, in a pot or in a garden – with proper care it will flower.', 'The most impressive creation is a water-powered calculator. With less than a sip of water, this calculator can work for two months! How much water would it need to run for a year… well, you do the math.', 'Fold and Play recycled speakers, another smart innovation, will appeal to a lot of music aficionados. Made out of recycled paper, these ultra-light speakers prove to be easy on the wallet as well as the environment. And guess what? They don’t need any batteries or external power outlets to run on. Just plug and play; they work with most audio devices.', 'Last is a bird-feeder that works more like a quick attachment kit. It is made out of recycled empty plastic bottles. All you have to do is attach the device to the empty bottle by punching two holes in. Insert the hanger (see pic), turn the feeder over, remove the plug and fill the bottle with seeds. Replace the plug and the feeder is ready to use. The bird-feeder is completely eco-friendly as it is made of Polylactic acid (PLA) and the string is made with recyclable bamboo.', 'While a lot of young people are exploring ways to make biodegradable waste useful – a trend that is gaining popularity – not everyone in this business has had it easy. Entrepreneur sisters Madhvi and Radhika Khaitan from Jaipur, have been creating innovative décor products out of industrial waste and discarded items.', 'They have had a lot of success “upcycling” (recycling while adding creative value to something) waste. But their struggle to give peoples’ mindsets a makeover is a never-ending one. Laments Madhvi, “Changing the notion that ‘eco-friendly means earthy colors and dull concepts’ is the primary challenge and propagating the idea that factory and household waste is more than just dirt or ‘kachra’, a hard task.”', 'You ask how the Khaitan sisters have overcome such hurdles and Madhvi says, “Now our target market are the people who have a green conscience. Being in this business for two and a half years, we have been able to determine that customers between the age group of 20-35 have been our top buyers. Today’s youth have developed a strong green conscience and have become front-runners in India’s ‘green’ movement.”', 'Though in theory green, WorkshopQ’s range boasts of vibrant hues. The color-blocked aluminium range of trays, photo frames and clocks is a quirky mix of waste aluminium composite panels, procured from a factory site. “This range is simply pieces of aluminium cased in wooden frames made of salvaged wood.”', 'Industrial waste isn’t all that has come handy; the sisters have played around with junk stashed up in forgotten corners of their home too. “The vinyl record clocks have been made out of actual vinyl records that were stashed in the attic of my grandmother’s house,” quips Madhvi. The steel mirror range has been handcrafted and made out of hardened steel strips (with no tensile strength), all by hand. Speaking about the mirror, Madhvi adds, “The owners of the factory site from where we procured these steel strips could not recognize that these mirrors were made from their own factory waste material.”', 'The sense of ownership that Madhvi and Radhika feel towards their products stems from their actual proximity to them. “We hope to increase awareness concerning both ecological and social responsibilities through our products by employing only handmade processes,” concludes Madhvi, with an added twist, “WorkshopQ simply means a Workshop for ‘Q’uirky products.”\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

2,2012-9,"['Archives', 'On World Literacy Day, Susheela’s Kolams Traveled Across The Nation']","['\n\n\nby\n\nMeena Vaidyanathan\n\n\nSeptember 12, 2012, 10:54 am \n\n\n', 'International Literacy Day was celebrated all over the world on the 8th of September in many different ways. In India, Pratham Books had an ambitious plan for the day – to get 100 volunteers to conduct storytelling sessions in their towns, villages or cities. A lofty plan like this had all the chances of failure, and at times it looked like it might. But guess what, as time drew close, they got 250 volunteers representing each and every state in India! Thousands of children were read a story – “Susheela’s Kolams”, specially chosen for this day, about a girl who loves Kolams (a form of rice painting drawn with rice powder/chalk, also known as Rangoli) and dreams big. One of the volunteers was our friend and writer Meena Vaidyanathan, who conducted a session in Assam and shares her experience with us.', 'Literacy has different meanings for different people. A few years ago, just being able to sign one’s name was considered enough to be deemed “literate”. Since then, even the statutory definition of literacy has changed. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has defined literacy as the “ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate, compute and use printed and written materials associated with varying contexts.”', 'To create and interpret and communicate, children need to imagine and articulate their thoughts. What better way to inculcate these skills than storytelling? Story telling is an art that has mental, social and educational benefits on children. Besides, who doesn’t love the warm, fuzzy feeling one gets from listening to a good story?', 'Listening to stories help kids imagine a world of their own weaving in the words that they hear into a fabric that is unique, that can potentially help shape his or her personality and thinking. Much more sometimes than what they may do learning from a class lesson, and it definitely helps kids broaden their ability to imagine and express than watching television endlessly. Through stories, kids can get to learn about places, practices in life, relationships etc. Stories also allow children to know about their own cultural roots, differences between cultures and various lifestyles and also learn about new worlds, while helping kids to visualize the plot and characters.', 'So when Pratham Books thought of a country-wide storytelling as a way to mark the International Literacy Day, I jumped at it. “Susheela’s Kolams” was a beautiful book. Simple, colourful but more importantly, introduced so many new words and concepts in a fun manner. How many opportunities do children in the far east get to learn about Tamil Nadu and a word called “Kolam”? But they did, and learnt how to make them! They learnt about the Air Force and about trains. I conducted the story telling session at the Nabprabhat Orphanage in Tezpur in Assam, with about 20 kids, none of who had been in a train before. And Susheela’s kolams helped them visualize their own little train journey. We read the story together and then learnt how to make kolams. The enthusiasm was palpable and the creativity oozing out!', 'None of the kids had Hindi or English as their first language. But the pictures and the expressions helped them understand the nuances of the story, and they answered questions with such gusto and asked such probing questions that it made me realize just how much the process of story-telling encouraged them to participate in the learning process. Hearing stories with interesting expressions and a patterned speech helps break the code of language, the sounds of words, the rhythm of sentences, and bring out the emotion even in the youngest of children. Kids love to talk instead of listening to anything. Storytelling gives them the necessary training to listen and understand instead of talking, helping them nurture valuable life skills that will enable them not just to become literate but also well-rounded individuals! As children experience an entertaining story, they pair this positive emotion with storytelling, which encourages them to explore and experience it again, listening to others, perhaps even to recorded stories, and eventually telling their own.', 'This wasn’t the first time I was doing a story telling session and definitely won’t be the last. But a campaign that got a whole lot of story-telling volunteers to reach out to thousands of kids forebodes the beginning of something different. Hopefully with the momentum continuing, we will be able to offer the young ones of today knowledge packaged in exciting, interesting, yummy stories, that combines bits of history, geography, good morals, strong values, and insights into life!!', 'After all, isn’t a literate society all about a continuum of learning? In enabling individuals to achieve their goals, to develop their knowledge and potential, and to participate fully in their community and wider society.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

While hoping to see the King Cobra in all its glory, he gets a chance to soak in the splendour of the rich flora and fauna, while getting soaked to the bone in incessant rain. In this dream-like account of his adventure, with a generous sprinkling of breath-taking facts, he takes us into the heart of the Western Ghats, which was recently declared a World Heritage Site.', 'It rained and it rained, for five days and five nights. Whenever there was a momentary respite, unseen birds would sing from trees that had long back disappeared into the mist.', 'It was the second coming of the monsoon. Just when everyone thought it was the end of the season, it met us on the border of Goa and Karnataka, and travelled with us all the way to Udipi, and then up into the magical mountains of Agumbe.', 'Agumbe in the Western Ghats receives the second highest rainfall in India. And when it rains here, there are very few places on earth that are as enchanting. Agumbe has 54 square kilometers of pristine rainforests teeming with wildlife that is endemic to this unique habitat. Apart from being home to an exotic variety of insects, flowers, birds and butterflies, it’s also the land of reptiles, and the capital of the most mysterious snake of them all, the King Cobra.', 'Walking past the snake shrine and the temple pond near Agumbe Rainforest Research Station, I was reminded of a similar shrine in my ancestral home in Kerala. My fascination for snakes started from that shrine, somewhere in my childhood. My great grandmother used to feed milk to the snakes that inhabited the shrine, once a year. Family folklore has it that once she forgot all about the ritual, and a golden snake crawled into our house to gently remind her of the lapse! My early memories of that snake shrine are one of fear and fascination. Made of black stone, it instantly invoked a primordial respect. And it stood majestically under a canopy of ancient, intertwined creepers that looked like snakes in perpetual copulation. Every day a stone lamp would be lit there, and I would accompany my grandmother in the hope of getting a glimpse of the golden snake.', 'When we reached the Research Station at Agumbe, we were asked to unpack our bags at the guest house and immediately start on our trek to the Onakke Abbe Waterfalls.', 'We walked through curtains after curtains of rainfall, and despite the heavy rain gear that we had worn, we were drenched to the bone in a matter of minutes. The rain falling incessantly on the evergreen leaves created a pitter patter that had the monotone of meditative music. Even the sun trying to pierce the translucent clouds created a silvery light that enveloped the entire forest. Suddenly the forest path narrowed, and in front of us there was a carpet of decayed leaves teeming with leeches. As we continued our march into the heart of the rainforest, it dawned on me that leeches are the forests’ first line of defence, keeping unwanted guests at bay. After an arduous pilgrimage, we reached Onakke and saw the breathtaking sight of a waterfall taking a sheer drop of over 300 feet into a valley of mist. And the best part of the view was that we were right on top of this magnificent waterfall, looking down at the white cascade.', 'On our way back, we took a short cut. And we realized to our dismay that a short cut in a forest doesn’t mean reaching faster. On the path less travelled there were many gigantic trees that had fallen down creating an Olympian hurdle. We had to climb over these massive trunks every 100 metres to reach the base camp.', 'Our next trip was in the night. Armed with searchlights, we ventured to see the night life of the forest. Right near the gate was a lime tree on which all the four stages of a butterfly were seen on four different branches: the egg, the larva, the pupa and the butterfly! The common mormon butterfly that emerged during the day was lingering on the mother tree, just for one more night, before taking off into its own dawn.', 'Then on the tree tops, snuggling into each other, was a shy, elusive pair of Slender Loris, with their large eyes gleaming eerily in the light of the torch.', 'Next up was the exotic Malabar Gliding Frog, camouflaged so perfectly that only the eagle eyes of Vipul, our friend, philosopher and guide, could have spotted it. As part of our orientation, he picked it up gently from the leaf. As if to justify its name, it glided from Vipul’s hand to mine. And then Vipul explained to me an amazing fact about this frog. Though green in colour, it has two thick red lines running along its sides. When it sits on a leaf it flattens its body completely so that this ‘manufacturing defect’ is hidden, and it’s completely camouflaged with the evergreen leaf!', 'On our way back, we stopped by at the place where Saroja had spotted a Pit Viper in the afternoon. The attempt was futile; but I couldn’t help thinking that just as we were looking for it, it must have been watching us from the dense foliage nearby.', 'Back at the camp, we were lulled into sleep by the soothing raga of the brooks that flowed on either side of the cottage, and the pleasant rhythm of the raindrops falling on the tiled roof. It must have been the Megh Malhar raga.', 'The next morning, we sighted a slender, green vine snake just outside the cottage. As we approached it, it opened its large, red mouth as a matter of defensive display. Assuring that it’s completely non-poisonous, Vipul gently lifted it off the tree and transferred it into my hands, and it slithered up to my shoulder. And I remembered that distant afternoon when I accidentally met Romulus Whitaker, the Snake-man of India, and the head of Agumbe Rainforest Research Station. It was 34 years ago. I had gone with my English Professor Shama Futehally to her sister Zai’s house in Bandra. As I sat on a sofa waiting for Shama to finish her work, I saw a couple of snakes sliding into the drawing room from the bedroom. Soon, there were half a dozen of them. One of them dared to climb the sofa and slither towards my mortified hand. Just as it started climbing up to my shoulder, another one slithered across my frozen feet. It was a moment of truth for me, as it marked the end of my fear of snakes and the beginning of my love for them. Later, Shama told me that these were injured, non-poisonous snakes rescued by Rom, and were to be treated and then released in the forests of Sanjay Gandhi National Park.', 'Back at Agumbe, there was no respite from the downpour. After a few moments of the joy of wearing dry clothes, we were back in the midst of torrential rain as we proceeded to a picturesque hill called Kundadri. After a steady climb along a road that was surprisingly lined with yellow flowers on one side, and white flowers on the other, we reached the top. And there, the serpentine road stopped abruptly at the stone sculpture of a snake. Beyond that sculpture was a dilapidated Jain temple. And all around the temple were mountains floating in the mist. To the right of the temple was an amazing pond, where the water level remains exactly the same, in the height of monsoon and the peak of summer!', 'The evening trek was to discover Vipul’s secret waterfall. Walking adventurously through a rivulet in spate, wrapped in endless sheets of rainfall, we reached a massive tree, its buttress roots measuring a whopping 40 feet across. Endemic to tropical rainforests, these trees spread their roots far and wide above the ground, to trap the leaves that fall incessantly. In the crevices of these roots the leaves decay, and become the nutrition for the tree to grow further and further into the skies. As we turned the next corner we saw the pleasing sight of a friendly waterfall; the kind that’s gentle and beautiful, rather than the kind that inspires awe. It’s where Vipul retreats in his private moments for meditating on life and its meaning.', 'Then came the highpoint of our trip. Here at Agumbe, the very first study of King Cobra in his natural habitat was underway. Its behaviour was being observed by implanting a transmitter in its body and then tracking its movements with a receiver. The King currently being tracked was in a self-imposed exile in a termite mound at the outskirts of a village called Kesargonda. It had disappeared into the mound and hadn’t come out for two weeks now.', 'A lot is known about the King, but more is unknown. It’s known that King Cobra is the only snake-eating snake. It’s the largest venomous snake in the world, measuring up to 15 feet at its best. It’s the only snake that builds a nest to lay its eggs. It doesn’t normally waste its venom on humans, since the venom is precious and in short supply. And when the hatchlings came out of the eggs, the Queen slowly slithers away, lest its instinct to eat other snakes overpowers its maternal instinct!', 'In the evening, Gowrishankar, the head of ARRS, and his wife Sharmila, took us to Dodda Maney in the town of Agumbe, to see a 150-year old heritage house, peopled with some of the most beautiful smiles you can ever hope to see. It’s the house where Malgudi Days was filmed.', 'When we were returning in the night, Gowri was at the wheel. Suddenly he pressed the brake, and the vehicle came to a screeching halt in the stillness of the forest. He got down and gently picked up a little, bronze-coloured snake that was about to cross the road. And walking in the torrential rain, he deposited it safely on an overhanging branch, and came back with a smile that had traces of relief in it.', 'On the last morning, right in front of the cottage in the yonder paddy fields, there were three large egrets and a pair of white-necked storks swimming silently in the mist. And as we bid farewell to Vipul and his gang at the gate, we knew that we were leaving a part of us behind at Agumbe, only to come back on another rain-soaked day to reclaim it.', 'Passing by Gowri’s house, I remembered the warmth with which he had carried the little snake back to where it belonged: the dark, mysterious rainforests of Agumbe. And I knew in my heart that one day the elusive Kings of Agumbe would reveal all their dark, mysterious secrets to him.

Here we present the story of Dr. Mapuskar, an unsung hero who has worked relentlessly to ensure that the village he worked in achieved a high level of hygiene and sanitation. He did this through awareness campaigns, experimentation with technology, planning and executing projects by mobilizing the community and making them stakeholders. It is an inspiring story indeed.', 'Dr. Mapuskar has been working in the field of rural sanitation for the last 50 years. He implemented the principles of appropriate technology and community ownership at a time when these were not part of the national consciousness. Today he continues to be active in the field, advocating the use of decentralised, low cost sanitation options. This article presents his story and a film about his organisation.', 'The beginning: There were ghosts about, the young doctor was told as he settled down for the night on the hospital verandah. Despite that, he slept well. The true trial came the next morning when he discovered that the hospital did not have a toilet. As he made his way through the village to the forest, he came across a number of the villagers he had met the last evening. Mortified with shame, he made a decision. ‘Never again’, he decided.', 'That young man was Dr. Mapuskar. Just out of college, he had approached the Directorate of Health Services for a job. The only one was in a village called Dehu, he was told. The young man agreed and moved there. After that memorable first night- and morning – his first self-appointed task was to excavate a simple trench toilet for himself. Used medicine cartons formed the walls of this toilet. The next was to start a revolution.', 'Early efforts: In the course of his practice, Dr. Mapuskar realised he was never called on to treat more than a handful of illnesses – all hygiene related. He realised that he needed to tackle the cause of the infections. When looking for methods, he came across the book ‘Excreta disposal in rural areas’ published by the WHO. He bought the book, selected a design and constructed 10 toilets. This proved to be an abysmal failure. The designs were not designed for India; all the toilets collapsed in the monsoon. This proved a serious setback to Dr. Mapuskar’s efforts at promoting toilets. The incident also brought home the importance of appropriate technology. He began again to speak with his own staff and with the larger community about the importance of sanitation and hygiene.', 'The turning point: In 1963, Dr. Mauskar initiated a worm infestation survey. The funds for this were obtained from the Gram Sabha. He achieved 100% coverage of the households, and learned that 86% of the residents were infected with worms. In order to explain the origin, he set up two microscopes, one with a sample of infected faeces and the other with a soil sample. They were found to both have worm eggs. This helped to convince the villagers of the origin of the infection. The entire village was dewormed with medication obtained from the government. He also explained that the medicine required for deworming the village cost Rs.10,000/- and would need to be repeated every thee months. At that time, the cost of a toilet was Rs. 400/-. This went a long way to convince the villagers of the importance of toilets.', 'The village conducted a massive awareness campaign with processions, household visits, group discussions etc. The procession organised during this campaign ended with a massive meeting attended by nearly all the villagers. A decision to construct Appasaheb Patwardhan’s ‘sopa sandas’ toilets was passed at this meeting. A toilet construction committee was appointed for the actual implementation, with a secretary to manage funds. Households desiring to build a toilet came and deposited Rs. 400/- with the secretary. Any leftover money was handed back to the families. On this no-profit-no-loss principle, 100 toilets were built in a month. By 1980, the village had achieved 90% coverage.', 'Next steps: In 1980, Dr. Mapuskar began promoting the bio-gas toilets developed by Appasaheb Patwardhan. The first person to adopt these was Mrs. Pardeshi. She was convinced to build two toilets, one for her family and one for the neighbours. The neighbours were charged Rs 5/-per month. Soon, this pay-and-use toilet along with the sale of compost and generation of gas earned the family Rs. 700/- per month against a one-time investment of Rs 1300/-. Today, there are 75 such bio-gas toilets functioning in the village. Over the next 5 years, Dr. Mapuskar modified the original design and developed the Malprabha bio-gas toilet.', 'Later, decentralised on-site integrated waste management (DOSIWAM) was developed and is now implemented in 25 sites across the country. Dr. Mapuskar also set up two organisations, the Jyotsna Aarogya Prabodhan and the Appasaheb Patwardhan Safai Wa Paryawaran Tantraniketan to work on health awareness and appropriate technology. The team has also been working on bio-gas composters for vegetable waste, monitoring for the Sant Gadgebaba Abhiyaan, and lobbying for policy change in the field of sanitation and hygiene.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Prolonged illness, depression and lack of family support almost pushed the once a healthy man to the brink of suicide. In your worst times, sometimes the best friends might also leave you to yourself. However, one of his closest friends and well wisher introduced him to a place, after which not only did he start reliving his past days but he also injected more life to each passing day. So, what was this place?', 'In a quiet corner adjacent to Joggers’ Park near Carter Road in Mumbai, is Laughter Heaven – a silent laughing club. Wait a second – did I say “Silent Laughing Club”? Exactly! Operated by some of the elderly residents of Bandra and surrounding areas, this laughing club is a happy home for many elderly who are trying to re-figure the purpose of life after retirement. It started around 15 years back and was officially inaugurated on 26th January 1999. Since then, the club has brought smiles to thousands of wrinkled faces who have been a part of this family at some point of time. Even today, the club boasts of members who have devoted more than a decade of their lifetime to spreading the joy, that is fast disappearing from today’s stressful lives.', 'Mr. B Hirani, the President of Laughter Heaven, explains the unique concept of the club’s membership. “We do not charge any money for the membership. If you want to become a member of the club, all you have to do is be a part of the family continuously for 3 months, and you’re a member”. And once a person gets addicted to Laughter Heaven, it takes a mighty reason to leave.', 'Yoga, Laughter and Naturopathy\nThe activities of Laughing Heaven are based on three concepts – Yoga, Laughter and Naturopathy. The morning starts with Yoga and Pranayam exercises from 6:30am. This is followed by Prayers. This blend of physical fitness with spiritual fitness is what is required to be completely fit, according to the members of the club. After the prayers, announcements on birthdays, anniversaries or other good news are made and the respective member is wished/greeted by the rest. While they enjoy, they do it in a way that does not disturb the residents of the buildings nearby – which is what makes it a silent laughing club. As a part of Naturopathy, the members enjoy the morning breakfast of sprouts and a drink made up of Tulsi (Holy Basil) and Ajwain (carom seeds). This routine hasn’t changed in years.', 'Laughter Heaven is one place where the members open up themselves to share their happiness, sorrows, confusions, disappointments and even gossip! The club celebrates every moment of happiness – birthdays, anniversaries, birth of grandson/granddaughter, professional achievements and many more. The members also find shoulders to cry on sad occasions. But it is made sure that such moments do not last long and the member comes back to normalcy soon. The club also celebrates birthdays of all the members on the fourth Sunday of every month. The club organizes frequent outings to nearby places like Shirdi, Mahableshwar, etc', 'Road Ahead\nToday, the club witnesses about 130-150 members coming daily in the morning to make a better life – or at least a better morning. People with depression, joint pains, heart problems, asthma, other respiratory diseases have found peace and good health in this place and have made themselves medicine-free within months. With growing popularity by word-of-mouth, the family has been expanding and continuously bringing smiles to more faces every morning. People who cannot share their feelings with their blood-family members, open their heart out with this family.', 'Going ahead, the objective is to increase the “smileage” – more smiles per face.
