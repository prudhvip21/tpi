In this video, learn how she has adopted organic practices on her farm and tripled her profits in addition to reaping many other benefits!', 'Kalaivani, a single mother of three, took to farming after the loss of her husband almost two decades ago. Since then, she has grown all the crops on her farm without using chemical or synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. Over the last few years, she has focused her time and energy in growing organic cotton.', 'People often associate the cotton crop with parched lands and farmer suicides but Kalaivani insists that cotton can be profitable when grown organically. Organic inputs like Panchagavya and Jeevamritham, both of which contain cow dung as their main ingredient, not only improve the crop yield but also enrich the soil. Organic pesticides and growth promoters can be made at no extra costs. Farm and cattle left overs can be effectively used to conjure up a host of different potions to boost plant growth and immunity.', 'Cotton is a 6 month crop. Flowers bloom when the crop is a month and a half old. This gives way to the unripe fruit at the end of two months. The pod doesn’t burst until the 4th month. At the end of 4 months, the fruits slowly dry up and dehisce or split open. Cotton picking commences a few days after the first burst.', 'On an average, a farmer invests around Rs. 10,000 to 15,000 for an acre of organic cotton. This includes the cost of seeds, costs involved in preparing the land and wages. Organic cotton is sold at a higher rate compared to those grown using chemical fertilizers and pesticicdes.', 'When chemicals are used, the crop lasts around six months and cotton can be picked three times at the most. When purely organic inputs are used, the crop stands for more than 6 months, so more than 3 pickings are possible. More cotton equals more money. In addition, over time, the quality and texture of the soil improves and the amount of water required for the crop’s sustenance substantially reduces. Watch Kalaivani explain how she achieved this on her farm (if you cannot view the video here, please click on this link):', 'Overall, moving away from chemical farming has proved to have a lasting effect on the soil as well as the yield per acre.', 'In her spare time, Kalaivani travels to villages in the vicinity, to spread the word, one farmer at a time. She can be reached on (0)-98654-85221.', 'Many thanks to Mr. P. Alagesan, Programme Co-ordinator, and the staff of MYRADA Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Gobichettipalayam, Erode district for all their help and support in getting this information.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

It took 15 years of convincing villagers and enlisting their participation, but the beautiful forest is now replete with fauna and flora. Although the man is no longer among us, his legacy still exists for all to see, appreciate and enjoy. Truly, a life well spent!', 'When a journalist named D. M. Mohite visited the famed Tadoba sanctuary in 1970, he was amazed by the way this forest was being nurtured and protected. And he sadly remembered how an entire forest in his native village of Devrashtra in Sangli was being destroyed by the wanton felling of trees and the insatiable grazing of cattle.', 'Instantly he saw a vision of the dry mountain slopes in his village being nursed back into the green of health. But it took him 15 tenacious years to convince the villagers and the powers-that-be to actually do it.', 'This forest is called Sagareshwar Sanctuary, and it’s the only man-made sanctuary in India where all the animals have been re-introduced.', 'The first thing Mohite did after he came back to his village was to get the villagers to agree to stop the grazing of cattle. Then, with shramadaan (voluntary work through physical effort), he and the villagers planted thousands of indigenous saplings across the length and breadth of this degraded forest. For years, they carried water from the nearby villages and tended to them with love and care. Once these saplings grew up to be young trees, wild animals were brought in with the help of the forest department: sambar deer, spotted deer, blackbuck, fox, wild boar, snakes, mongoose and porcupine. Birds and butterflies though just breezed in!', 'This forest is also a rare example of continuous upgradation by the forest department over the last three decades. First, it was declared a deer park, then a forest reserve, and then a wildlife sanctuary. It is fenced all around, except for the animal migration corridors. And all this happened when Mohite was still around.', 'We reached there on a Tuesday, and fortunately the park is closed to casual visitors on all Tuesdays. So we had the entire guest house to ourselves, as also the forest. And it’s truly a great feeling when you have 10 square kms of forest all to yourself.', 'Though there were over a 100 species of birds there, the national bird was conspicuous by its presence. Their loud calls welcomed us, and as we walked to the first waterhole, we saw them in all moods and poses: some on treetops with their bronze feathers glistening in the morning light; some busy pecking on the morning dew; some perfecting their majestic rain dance; and some gliding down from their perches and leaving behind a streak of ultramarine blue.', 'But Mohan Karnat, the Chief Conservator of Forests, Kolhapur, shared with us a stunning ecological truth: a spurt in the numbers of peacocks is not a good sign for the habitat! Simply because, being voracious eaters, they polish off copious quantities of newly sprouted grass, thereby destroying the grasslands. In the true wild, this balance is maintained by predators.', 'Then we saw plum-headed parakeets, green barbets called veda raaghu for their insane flight pattern, hoopoes, crested larks, and a whole colony of baya weaver birds.', 'A walk in the forest here is enough to convince you that this is an ideal place for eco-tourism. Probably that’s why Mohan Karnat and his dedicated team consisting of S. Zhure and S. Naykal are busy setting up a cluster of beautifully designed cottages, a nature interpretation centre, and an amphitheatre to screen wildlife films so that visitors are sensitized to the forest and all that dwells in it.', 'Situated at a height of 2700 feet, the scenic Sagareshwar is probably the only wildlife sanctuary that has ‘Points’ like in a hill-station. So you have the Ranshool Point, the Kirloskar Point and the Mahangund Point. As we were trekking up the mountain, I realized the pressures of tourism on this tiny sanctuary.', 'Inside the forest is the Lingeshwar temple that’s the twin-brother of the Sagareshwar temple outside. So any devotee who visits Sagareshwar feels that he hasn’t collected enough blessings, and makes it a point to visit Lingeshwar to collect some more. Just to give you an idea, the day before we reached here was the last Monday of the month of Shravan, and the sanctuary log showed an entry of, hold your breath, 28,963 visitors! Signs of their devotion were littered all over the place and over 20 people had to work non-stop to tidy up. In fact, our guide Dokle and a young lady forest guard Devki were collecting the trash missed by the earlier team, even as they were spotting birds and bees for us.', 'In the evening we drove down to Mohityanche Vadgaon, named after the progenitor of this sanctuary, Mohite. The idea was to spot the blackbucks that one fine morning had decided to migrate to this village through the gaps in the fence of the sanctuary. They had moved here a few years ago, and never came back. We did find two groups of blackbucks on the fringes of the farmlands. Maybe they came here looking for their alpha male, Mohite. And are still looking for him.', 'How to get there: Sagareshwar is around 380 kms from Mumbai. Take the Mumbai-Kolhapur Highway and turn at Karad. The nearest railway station is Sangli.\nWhere to stay: The Forest Rest House.

It focuses on enabling these youth to have access to jobs without leaving the villages. On the whole, this is positively impacting the development of rural parts of India as well as giving stable jobs and incomes to the people.', 'He promised his parents that he would go to the city and make a good living there. He was sure he would get a good job and a decent income. He told himself that he would regularly send back some money to his ageing parents. He thought that the city would be the answer to all his problems. But in reality, it was nothing like what he had dreamt. It was difficult to get a job and even harder to find a place to stay. The city life was hard and he soon found himself returning to his village, hopes and ambitions crushed.', 'This is the life story of thousands of youth across our country. The limited progress in rural areas forces them to leave behind their families and flock to the cities in hopes of making a decent living. This is mainly because the metropolis and urban parts of our country are rapidly developing, leaving their rural counterparts in the dust. However, unless rural India is included in the nationwide development, the progress will not be sustained in the long run.', 'The Beginning\nThese two problems led to the genesis of an organization christened RuralShores. Founded by a group of highly successful and motivated professionals headed by Mr. Murali Vullaganti, it drives the implementation of a very unique idea. It is driven by social motive and does not intend to materially benefit from the venture.', 'Usually, the rural youth is lured to the cities for non-critical business transactions such as data entry, simple book keeping, expenses handling and document digitization. Instead of bringing them to the offices in cities, why not bring the offices to them? Their tagline, ‘Bringing jobs to the people rather than bringing people to the jobs’ seems to convey their initiative in a nutshell. This would benefit not only the villages, but also the companies that ‘take the jobs to the people’ in the form of cost benefits.', 'How It Works\nThis organization ropes in enthusiastic youth from the villages and trains them to be able to perform basic computer and English-speaking tasks. RuralShores provides immense help to people in the villages. It gives opportunities to people with disabilities and also focuses on women empowerment. An impressive statistic reveals that nearly 50% of the workforce constitutes of female employees. The organization offers companies skill development solutions in sectors like Banking & Financial Services, Insurance, Retail, and Telecom. The foundation training is provided by local institutes specialized in skilled training for educated rural youth. After three months of training, they are ready to take on a job that can provide them with a sufficient means of livelihood.', 'The Impact\nThrough RuralShores, the standard of living of the employees and their families has undergone a tremendous. In an internal study done recently, it was found that employees have invested in household conveniences, besides providing for higher education for themselves and their siblings. The initiative has brought self-confidence and empowerment to the lives of thousands of people, without forcing them to relocate to the cities.', 'On the whole, RuralShores benefits society at three different levels. It brings employment, education, infrastructure and income into the villages. Corporate organisations have access to a dedicated work force and cost attrition. It also benefits India as a whole, contributing to rural development, improving literacy, expanding the talent pool, while simultaneously curbing urban migration.', 'RuralShores is a boon to villages because it also has a number of indirect effects. With a stable source of income, individuals can support family needs and higher education for youth. Educated individuals see the importance of education; hence they are motivated to send their children to school, improving literacy rates. Since migration to cities is curbed, families are no longer fragmented, retaining character and values.', 'The Journey So Far\nThis initiative is already in action. Over five years, RuralShores has launched 17 centres in operation in Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, employing more than 2500 rural youth. Each centre has an average of 100 seats with a capacity for 180 people in two shifts. Their main objective is to establish one RuralShores centre in each of the 500 rural districts of the country thereby providing sustainable employment to over 100,000 rural youths by 2025.', 'RuralShores has gained awards and recognition for its work. Some of them include the Economic Times BPO award – Social Catalyst and the Wall Street Journal’s Top Best 3 Innovations in the Asia Pacific.', 'It is promoted by a group of IIT/IIM educated and accomplished senior executives from E&Y, HP, HDFC Bank, Mastek and Wipro who share common values and a passion for rural development.', 'To bring India to the forefront, economic growth and development is needed, not only in the major cities but also in the rural parts of the country. Without development in the villages, it is impossible for the entire country to develop. When we grow, we have to grow as a whole and that needs to be realized.

Read about their unique approach to teaching those whom nobody else does!', 'It was 16 years back, in March 1998, that a group of like-minded individuals got together under the aegis of Dr. Shashi Rao and deliberated on what they could do for street children.', 'They were disturbed to see children of labourers, vegetable vendors, maid servants wasting their childhood living in an abusive environment. They were neither educated nor did they have an inclination towards education.', 'The challenges were multifold – schools were not ready to take them due to age and curriculum constraints, their parents didn’t want to send them to school for the child was required to baby sit the younger siblings or do household chores, and last but not least, the children hated school.', 'The Ananya team didn’t feel intimidated by these challenges, in fact they took it in their stride and asked a few children to come and spend time with them – first at Dr. Rao’s residence, later at public parks at a place and time convenient to both the students and the teachers. They would just sit and talk to them. In no time, the number of children grew from 2 to 22 and they started meeting in a park.', 'Children from various age groups and cultural backgrounds would sit together and share stories. They would talk about rain and cricket and flowers and thus started learning – contextual learning. There were no textbooks, only concepts which the children would themselves introduce without even knowing it. Dr. Rao recounted an incident where a child, while watching a cricket match on TV, said India needs four more runs to win and thus the concept of subtraction was introduced. There were innumerable such stories which revolved around concepts which the children wouldn’t just pick up but also enjoyed discussing about.', 'With their feet on the ground and children to look after, the Ananya team clearly knew what they wanted to achieve in the long run. They wanted to help these children grow up as matured and sensitive adults. The abuse that they would witness regularly in their homes or streets was tormenting them and it was best that they be kept away from such an environment. The team firmly believed that the children needed to spend their childhood in a warm and comforting environment away from the negativity that they were used to.', 'At this juncture, Ananya was offered a premise – a farm to run Ananya Trust. It was like a gift from God. Ananya Trust now had a roof, a tangible place where the children could eat, sleep, play and learn. This was a big milestone is Ananya’s growth story but was not without obstacles. The farm that brought cheer came with the constraint that it was outside the city premises. The kids’ parents were apprehensive about sending them far away for they were still expected to be available for vegetable shopping, etc. Since the commute to the farmhouse was long, it was impossible that they could still contribute in household chores.', 'The team took it upon themselves and ensured that the kids come back after spending time with them. On the way to the new premise, the teachers would encourage kids to make lists and shop for groceries and vegetables. The kids thus learnt a new concept – how to write and make lists. The parents also eventually starting feeling the difference that Ananya was making in their childrens’ lives. The kids were not just learning how to speak in English but a host of other things that made them look educated. They were well-fed and well-groomed.', 'Ananya, in no time, had made inroads into the hearts of the kids. They started loving Ananya for what it offered: learning that had no restrictions. The children were in command. They chose what they wanted to study, when they wanted to study, it was the “how” that the teachers took care of. There were no textbooks, the teaching mechanism was fluid and flexible. Children were loved, counselled, taken care of and only when they felt they were ready to learn something, concepts were introduced. There was no pressure of grasping a particular topic in a stipulated time frame or any exams.', 'Ananya runs with the belief that though a traditional school makes the student climb up the vertical ladder of standards, it is not necessary that the students have understood even the basics. The focus for Ananya Trust lies in identifying the capabilities and interest of the children and then imparting them with required skills. For example, a boy with an interest in photography is provided with the necessary skills, both theoretical and practical to become a good photographer.', 'Days and weeks passed, the model of everyday commuting from the city to the farmhouse left little time for education. Moreover, the travel was leading to exhaustion among the students. It was probably the inflection point when the core team proposed that children stay back in the night. This started with a one night a week kind of set up and was gradually scaled up to 5 nights a week. The children started staying on the farm; this move was welcomed by the children and parents alike. From one farm to another, Ananya shifted its base, however, the model continued to work.', 'Ananya Trust takes care of all the needs of the children associated with them, which includes food, clothing, lodging, medical aid and learning. All this, Dr. Rao feels has been possible only because of an extremely committed team which works towards it. Currently, there are 10 staff members, teaching and non-teaching, and 5 international volunteers that are associated with Ananya. The profile of teachers is as varied as the profile of the children but what is common among them is their dedication, commitment and love for the children. The teachers have a range of academic qualifications from PhDs to High school graduates. They do not teach a specific subject but use an integrated approach to teaching; incorporating life skills and everything else that a child needs to know to physically, socially and emotionally face the outside world.', 'Ananya needed funds to run its day to day operations and fortunately there have been donors. Friends, relatives, neighbors started contributing in their own way to the Trust. They have also been listed on GiveIndia which has been a major source of funding.', 'Ananya Trust, having touched the lives of 300 children so far, is going strong and has plans to further expand its capacity. Currently, it houses close to about 60 students every year with a child staying for an average of 8 – 10 years. This year, it will be a proud moment for the entire team, when a boy who has spent his growing years with Ananya will graduate with a Bachelors of Commerce. The dream which Dr. Shashi Rao and the team have nurtured for many years now is seeing the light of the day and that makes all the hard-work that they have put into it worthwhile!', 'Ananya means Unique.

With performances from stellar artists, this organization aims at including these children in the cultural space that is largely denied to them due to their peculiarities, and allowing them to immerse themselves in the therapeutic effects of creative arts.', 'Seven different colours form a rainbow. Different gestures, expressions and movements enhance the beauty of a dance. Seven different notes form a divine melody. Similarly, it is differences in people that make up a beautiful society. In a society demarcated with boundaries, social and physical, it is music and the arts that act as the unifier and leveler. In a society, prone to be wounded by tension and conflict, the creative arts act as a healer. Music and the arts see no religion, language and social status and reach out to the senses and the soul without any discrimination. This is the foundational premise for Tarang.', 'Tarang, a cultural initiative for persons with special needs and their caregivers was launched by V-Excel Educational Trust, a not-for-profit organization for children, in collaboration with Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (Chennai) on 3rd December, 2013 to commemorate the occasion of World Disability Day. The idea was to bind those with special needs into an inclusive society, to give them the joy of experiencing the beauty and harmony of the creative arts, besides promoting healing and therapeutic effects of the performing arts in special education.', 'Dr Vasudha Prakash, Director of V-Excel Educational Trust says:', 'Tarang is a symphony, but it is also a symphony that binds. It forms chords and bridges in the community between everybody, between the children with special needs. It also caters across age groups. We have children as young as 3 and 4 years and we also have adults with special needs. We have lifespan intervention with early intervention. Our oldest student is 40 years old. We have so many things available for them to do.', 'The Tarang seed was unknowingly sown by the Academy Award nominated Carnatic musician and singer, Bombay Jayshree, when the V-Excel Educational Trust-BVB association hadn’t taken place as yet. Music had always been part of the ‘classes’ at the NGO. Come every Friday, you would find eager listeners and participators among the special students in the music classes. While Vasudha noted that loud filmy music held great appeal for them, she imagined how the soothing touches of classical music could do wonders to their senses. A meeting with Jayshree solidified that belief. Vasudha recalls:', 'Suddenly one day, Bombay Jayshree, she said that tomorrow I am coming to your school at 2 PM to sing for the children. So we immediately put the shamiana together and it was a very beautiful and spontaneous thing that she did. She brought her accompanying artistes and we gathered the children from all our schools, around 100-150 children. We called all the children’s parents also. It was an amazing way in which the children sat through one hour very happily; it gave such a good energy in that place. So then we decided that we should do this again.', 'And there was no stopping after that. The first concert that lasted 20 minutes, had even autistic children who had difficulty sitting down for long periods of time, listening in rapt attention. The experiment had been hugely successful. Over the next three years, V-Excel continued conducting these free concerts on the last Friday of every month from 1 to 2 in the afternoon. They were supported by several dignitaries in the music fraternity to the likes of T M Krishna, Sowmya, Trichur Brothers, Anil Srinivasan, Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi, Vijay Shiva, Lalgudi GJR Krishnan, Shobana Balachandran and many more.', 'Vasudha noted how the special audience was not only getting culturally stimulated but also intellectually and behaviorally. There was a tangible difference in the way the children responded to music, they started opening up and gaining more confidence. They would react differently to the young artistes and the more seasoned artistes, to vocal music and instrumental music.', 'As time passed, more schools started participating and parents of the children with special needs began realizing the need for a recreational facility, which they could enjoy as a family. This led V-Excel to ultimately launch this initiative with the support and consent of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.', 'From the very beginning Vasudha had been particular about the music or art that is chosen to be presented to the students. What had to be showcased for the people with special needs and their caregivers had to reflect excellence in that field. Talking about this initiative, she says:', 'That was our vision, aisa nahin ki special children hai isliye kuch bhi suna de, it was not like that. (We never believed that these are special children so we can make them listen to anything). This is also going to be the place where we will display art by students who are hearing impaired, those who are good in singing or playing instruments will also be allowed to showcase their talent. We want art exhibitions, photography exhibitions. We want to showcase everything that could be included under culture in that space.', 'In fact, C Venkat, a prolific photographer specializing in insect photography has already volunteered to teach photography to the special children who show aptitude in this ‘technical’ art form. Who knows, they can bloom into professional photographers later in their lives and carve a niche for themselves? After all, some of the children are blessed with hypersensitive vision, a valuable physical trait in photography.', 'The initiative is also about being respectful and sensitive to the needs of special people, something that gets lost in the mainstream society. Picture this, how many times have you been to a classical music concert and seen a special child enjoying the performance with equal ease and the mainstream audience not getting distracted? Have you ever thought whether families’ enthusiasm in taking along their special children to public performances gets overshadowed by their apprehension and awkwardness? Formation of Tarang had this other underlying objective as well.\xa0Vasudha elaborates:', 'Persons with special needs, children with autism or mental retardation -sometimes they process differently. The large number of people in auditoriums, the kind of seating that they have is not amenable to this. Sometimes the children want to just get up, shout or wave their hands, do whatever they do, which is sensorially triggered. Some might look at it broadly or some may look at them with suspicion, they might think that this is a place for normal people and ask why they are being included. So it is nice that people who are understood will be there, the volume can be adjusted, the music can be fine-tuned based on the response, the interaction can be more. You can drop a bit of formality with the children.', 'The idea is not to exclude but to show the children that this is how it happens in a concert and if you want to go to a concert, say a music academy, you can use tickets. It gives a readiness for inclusion and we can also customise and create a special environment needed for persons with special needs to listen to music. Parents might feel very awkward to bring such children to concerts, if it gets late in the night. Then there is difficulty to get autos. So we can have these concerts in the afternoon. The school can bring them.

India’s abounding tradition of music, dance and other performing arts will be showcased and make way for a larger acceptance of disabled people in traditional settings. Tarang had its first cultural program on 3rd December, 2013. It was inaugurated by V-Excel’s brand ambassador, Bombay Jayashri. On the inaugural day, there was a piano recital by Anil Srinivasan, dance by Priya Murale and students of Shree Bharatalaya, songs sung by students of V-Excel and a classical music concert by Saindhavi Prakash.', 'The programs and performers are planned out well in advance. Not only do the students and their parents remain excited about the programs, but the performing artistes too love to put up their shows here. The experience is unmatched in terms of the warmth and acceptance they receive here without being judged.', 'Tarang is indeed putting up a good show and is doing marvelous work for not only those with special needs but their families too. As a result, the children are opening up and venturing into new zones which till before had been restricted to them. Due to their own set of challenges, they don’t socialize and make friends easily. The cultural initiatives of Tarang are filling in this vacuum and in the process, helping them to build their confidence and self-esteem and face the world. More interesting plans lie ahead from Tarang in order to create a more culturally active and inclusive society.', 'The next program is all set to take place on 19th February (tomorrow) between 1 and 2 pm at the Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan auditorium. The performer this time is singer Sandeep Narayan, who will be accompanied by M Vijay on the violin and NC Bharadwaj on the mridangam.

The building is ready and the classes are about to begin. The good samaritans who have come from various parts of the world to help complete this project have used up all of their funds. Now you can help run the school for a whole year. Know more about this wonderful effort.', 'Totopara is a marginalized tribal village in the jungles of North Bengal, situated on the border of Bhutan. The Toto tribe is one of the smallest communities in India, having a population of about 1500, who maintain their own spoken language. In 2009, one of the leaders of the Toto tribe, Bukul Toto, approached Lissa Davies and emphasized the need for a project that would address the problems faced by children in Totopara, especially with regard to the poor standard of education that they had been receiving. In order to co-ordinate and spearhead the setting up of a self-sustainable education center, Lissa set up the BEGAP or the Bright Eyes Global Action Project. Since then, through expert consult and community participation, BEGAP has been able to set up a cultural heritage and education center in Totopara.', 'About BEGAP\nBEGAP partners with locally run grassroots organizations and communities, and creates a platform to help them achieve their goals and reach out of their normal sphere of influence. They assist them by conducting research, providing consultation, helping with project management, fundraising and also providing them with skilled volunteers for their projects. By generating self-sustainable projects and activities, they have been successfully providing quality education to children from marginalized communities. They are also working with communities in Cambodia and North West India.', 'The Beginnings of the School\nSeveral years ago the tribe leaders generously donated a piece of land to BEGAP to build a school and heritage center. Since then the project has been coming up really well and they have already built a traditional bamboo house which serves as a heritage site. The education center is also in its final stages of construction. The center can accommodate about 50 children during the day and the space can utilized for cultural activities during evenings. Children from 2-7 years of age would be admitted and would be taught in preschool, nursery and KG classes. This facility is one of its kind in the entire village.', 'Watch this interesting video showcasing the journey so far (click here if you cannot view the link below):', 'Headstart Totopara – Project Video from mikey bramich on Vimeo.', 'The school aims to teach the local children in their mother-tongue, which includes Toto, Bengali, Nepali and Hindi. They are currently running a multi-linguistic curriculum in a small temporary classroom. Their ongoing project activities also include scripting the endangered Toto language, providing jobs to the community, preserving the identity of the Toto culture and help this society create a self-sustainable future.', 'The Linguistic Project\nThe Toto language is unscripted and listed as endangered by the government. Keeping this in mind, the project aims to work towards scripting the language for the first time. This would not only prove to be invaluable to young Toto’s education but will also strengthen and preserve the identity of the tribe. To complement the language preservation program efforts are also being directed towards collection of songs, poems and stories from the tribal elders and youth. . None of the elders’ traditional songs have been recorded in their entirety and will be likely disappear unless preserved. Professional film and audio equipment are used to create high quality recordings which will be given to the Toto community in DVD, CD or MP3 form.', 'To get a glimpse into their beautiful culture, watch this interesting video of the making of a traditional Toto house (click here if you cannot watch it below):', 'The Team\nThe people behind this project is a small, non-religious group of friends, volunteers and locals who are in love with Toto culture and it’s folk. Lissa Davies, the project director, is also an educator and anthropologist. Mikey Bramich is the Project Manager and also a teacher at the Totopara School. Prakash Toto happens to be a teacher, animator and project assistant. And, Mr Adam Pearson from the Cambridge University, is the Ethical Business Coordinator of the Totopara Project. They also have a large number of skilled volunteers and a number of partner NGOs that help in teaching, drama, linguistic activities and volunteer’s co-ordination.', 'What’s going on now\nHowever, only recently, the single donation on which the entire project was relying on has unfortunately fallen through, leaving them at a very critical juncture after five years of hard-work. Your contributions will help in the completion of the Chitaranjan Toto Education Center and help them run the project successfully for one complete year. The community and people behind this project have faced numerous challenges in setting up of this school. They have also faced theft by some local NGOs and have not received any help or assistance from anyone in this regard, in this remote tribal village. Despite such odds, the project has been moving ahead with significant momentum and has scheduled the opening of the school later this month. The funds generated would not only directly impact the education of this community, but will also help preserve the language and identity of the Toto tribe, which is struggling with poverty and cultural endangerment.', 'Can you do something here?\nThis project has been successfully running for about 5 years and the impact on the community has already been very positive. You can help them by exploring the various volunteering opportunities that BEGAP offers, such as, project managers, volunteer coordinators, applied anthropologists and experienced educators. You can also support them by engaging with them on their Facebook page and spreading awareness about their activities and programs.', 'In addition to this, you can aid their fundraising efforts on their Indiegogo campaign which is on till 20th Feb 2014: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/headstart-totopara-save-our-school-and-preserve-the-culture-of-a-unique-tribe', 'You can know more about them through their website.', 'So go ahead – save a school AND preserve the culture of a unique tribe!', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

This is where DIYA comes in – to lend a helping hand to differently-abled adults and ensure that they live a life of dignity.', '‘The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but reveal to them their own.’ – Benjamin Disraeli.', 'DIYA, a foundation that supports people with special needs and offers them opportunities for growth, self-reliance and independence, is accomplishing that and more.', 'Diya Foundation is a Vocational Training Centre cum Sheltered Workshop for adults who are intellectually challenged. It was founded in March 1999 by Maria S. Santamaria (known to all as Sarah) with experience in special education. Sarah started teaching at the Convent of Jesus & Mary Special School in Mumbai and earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Special Education from SNDT, Mumbai. She then shifted base to the USA and earned a Masters in Special Education from Cardinal Stritch College, Milwaukee. After gaining relevant experience and learning how the disabled in the US had dignity of labour, Sarah returned to India. She moved to Bangalore in 1995 post her marriage to Gerard, her pillar of support in all her endeavours.', 'As a special educator, Sarah realised that once these children reach the age of 14-18, they have nothing to do and nowhere to go because the special schools ask them to leave. She recalls a meeting with a mother of a boy (while working at Sophia Opportunity School, Bangalore) sharing this very dilemma with her. Unknown to the realities of life, the boy was only interested in getting married after finishing school. Says Sarah, ‘That is when it hit me that I failed him as a special educator because I had not equipped him with the skills required to deal with the challenges of life.’ This prompted her to work towards setting up a place where they could go to after leaving school to learn work skills in a trade that would help them earn and boost their self-esteem. Thus was born DIYA.', 'From small beginnings 14 years ago, DIYA today offers training and employment opportunities to the differently abled in the following units: Candle Making, Chocolate Making, Recycled and Handmade Paper products, Data Entry, Screen Printing and Horticulture/Gardening. They are also looking at setting up a Jewellery unit in the near future. The training is imparted over a period of 6 months to a year.', 'Diya was founded in March 1999, on an initial contribution of 1000 each from the 3 board members along with the unconditional support of family and friends. When it first began, Sarah visited schools like Divya Shanti, Sophia Opportunity, Baldwins’ Opportunity School to find out how the students fared as adults after completing school. She sought the help of these schools to inform the parents of the vocational training opportunities that Diya offered.', 'Today DIYA’s biggest challenge is in finding a permanent place (having moved 7 times) to put down roots and grow. They are looking at raising 5 crores in order to purchase their own land for expansion in their 15th year. With this they hope they will not have to say ‘no’ to any special needs individual looking for training and work opportunities.', 'Sarah fondly talks about the ‘eureka’ moments in her trainees’ lives : that first eye contact, the first conversation initiated, the first time a task was initiated or when they learned to tie the cords on a paper bag or hammer in the rivet. Such moments make up for lasting memories for each of the over 100 trainees so far trained at Diya.', 'Deepika, a 16-year-old girl with borderline retardation, assists in the production of candles. “Even when I am not here, I know she will do the tasks with ease as she is extremely responsible,” says Sukanya, her trainer. Deepika, who comes from Lingarajpuram, helps measure wax for melting, pours wax and packs the candles.', 'Divya, a mild mentally-challenged young adult makes around four to five kilos of chocolates a day. When she joined Diya three years ago, she was a timid and shy trainee. Today she expresses herself with ease in good English.', 'Every trainee who is trying to master a skill at their various units is an endearing reminder of how each one of them is special and is capable of so much more. All they need is support and that belief in them, which is at the heart of DIYA. From Yoga sessions every morning, to shared lunches, cleaning the premises, welcoming visitors – every activity is geared towards enhancing various skills.

All those trainees from Diya Foundation, who are proficient at working without ongoing supervision, are recruited by Diya Innovations. The company is competitive in the market in terms of quality and pricing with a vision to empower its specially abled employees to earn atleast the minimum wage.', 'EKta is a self-help group of parents (of special individuals) and underprivileged women mentored by Diya Foundation with a hope to provide employment to their trained spec\xad\xadial needs individuals in the future.', 'The people behind DIYA remain dedicated to their vision and are working towards the expansion of the Vocational Training Centre.

He did not bag any medals, but given the hardships he went through, his qualification itself was nothing short of a miracle! He represented a nation that was suspended from the Olympics, in a sport that had no backing or recognition in his home country. How many people in India had even heard of luge before Keshavan came into the picture? In lieu of his never-say-die attitude, when Shiva was left to fend for himself by the Indian authorities, a motley group of donors from all over the world came together to help him realise his dream. Here, Ashwin Mudigonda, entertainingly recounts the interesting chain of events that took place to make this happen and also introduces you to the mysterious world of crypto-currencies!', 'There is a scene in the Lord of the Rings when all hope for the protagonists appear to be lost in the mighty battle against Saruman at Helm’s Deep. And then, in the distance, a silhouette appears on a white horse and with a battle cry, swoops down upon the valley with an army of warriors, and thwarts the orc attack.', 'Dogecoin is as intangible as Gandalf, but its power far exceeds that of the grand wizard.', 'News appeared in the Washington Post (online) that Keshavan Shiva, a determined Olympic luge contender from Himachal Pradesh, was denied funds and training by the Indian government, and left to fend for himself for the Sochi Olympics. It wrenched many hearts. But when it was learned that he would not be allowed wave the tricolor because of India’s suspension from the International Olympic Committee, and that the Indian national anthem would not be played, it was rubbing salt in the wound.', 'Like pacing tigers in a cage, eager folks all over the world were itching to help, but had no idea where to start. Where was Keshavan? Did he have enough money to make it to Sochi? How could he be contacted? How much money does he need? Could a Kickstarter campaign be launched for him? ', 'An interesting event happened in the lead up to the Sochi Olympics. The Jamaican bobsled team needed about 35,000 USD to compete at Sochi, and they, too, were abandoned by their own government. The enthusiastic supporters of a nascent virtual currency called dogecoin rallied to their cause and raised the required money in a short time. Until that time, dogecoin was treated as a joke, but now it had shown that it could make a difference in people’s lives.', 'It was only natural for someone to post the same request on behalf of Keshav. The title of the appeal on Reddit read – “Olympic luge contender from India is hoping for a miracle to happen to help him realize his dreams. Do we know anybody with that power?” It was a typical post in the dogecoin subreddit community – sincere and cheeky at the same time. The first few comments poured in:', '“I feel like this needs to happen. Another underdoge who is looking for a miracle. I’ll donate 5000 doge if the foundation gets behind this.” – infernalaanger wrote.', 'The pledges began to trickle in, and the pressure began to build.

In minutes, the coins started gushing in. People were ecstatic. They wanted to give more, and in the spirit of the community, many of them who commented on the thread saying that they just donated were themselves given tips (in dogecoins) by others.', 'The inside joke amongst the shibes (as dogecoin enthusiasts are known) was that their currency, just like Bitcoin, the granddaddy of all cryptocurrencies, would also become extremely valuable, and so, “To the moon!” became a victory cry each time the value of the currency went up.

He has been managing to train and compete with all the money he raises personally. In simple words, he mainly represents the country at his own expense. FYI, the total required budget for a Season is approximately INR 50 Lakhs, which Shiva has raised personally all these years. There are no facilities or infrastructure in India, which forces him to train abroad, something like the Jamaican team. It was 2 months prior to the 2010 Olympic Games and now for the 2014 Games that the Govt. offered support, nothing in the middle. Also, please note that they were part sanctions, which means they only gave him 5-10% of the total amount actually required by him.

But it isn’t. The last decade was ruled by the internet. The future, from here on, will be owned by decentralized cryptocurrencies. What started as a mysterious and incomprehensible concept – bitcoin – slowly evolved into a juggernaut today. And since the concept was open-sourced, others were free to copy it.', 'This is how cryptocurrencies work. Let us assume that there are ten glasses of bubble-tea – that delicious Taiwanese milk tea with balls of tapioca balls. The goal is to drink the tea (not suck up and eat the balls). The rule is that only after the first glass is emptied can the next one be approached. And also, the size of the balls increases and the quantity of tea reduces with every glass.', 'Now in this quite funny setup, any person (and this is the strength of the system; unlike a bank, you don’t need to verify yourself to “open an account”) with a straw is deemed a miner. He puts the straw in the first glass and slurps. Because the balls are small, if he gets one in his straw, he can blow it away and resume drinking the tea. Someone else can join him with his own straw and share the tea. This continues until all the tea is drunk. Then all the “miners” proceed to the next glass. However now, the effort involved in drinking the tea will be more because the tapioca balls are larger and a lot more effort will be spent discarding the balls, and searching for the tea.', 'As this game progresses, more people realize that there is free tea to be had, and rush with their straws. The tea gets drunk quicker and quicker, and people move on to the next glass where it becomes even more difficult to drink.', 'And that in a nutshell is how all the cryptocurrencies are “mined”', 'Initially, there are 0 coins. Anyone with an internet connection can mine these coins. Mining requires one to possess decent computing power to perform calculations. When the calculations are successful, the coins are rewarded to the person. When the mining for any currency initially begins, the complexity of the problems are designed to be very simple, and they payouts very high. So, pioneers in search of the gold vein can easily mine hundreds or even thousands of coins using a PC with a decent CPU (like i5/i7).', 'As the number of coins cross certain predetermined thresholds, the complexity increase, and the payouts decrease. Now, only users with powerful GPUs may reap the rewards. However, it’s still possible to mine “solo” at this stage.', 'Eventually, and this is the case with bitcoin today, the complexity reaches insane amounts, and the payouts also decrease. It then makes no sense to mine solo. Not only does the chance of finding coins reduce, but cost of the energy involved in running a PC 24/7 outweighs any coins mined. This is when users opt for one of two routes: the quicker way is to join a pool where many users’ computing power is combined, and the rewards are proportionately split depending on the contributions. Or, to purchase powerful mining rigs and go solo. These rigs are very expensive, but they are capable of solving blocks quickly.', 'Coins can be stored on a PC in something known as a wallet. Coins can also be sent to other wallets in a very simple fashion. One puts the recipient’s address (a very long set of numbers and letters) along with the number of coins, and hit send. The coins jump from PC to PC (hence the word decentralized) and after about 6 jumps, it reaches the sender. It can take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours for transactions to happen.', 'The true power of bitcoin will be realized when a teenager in a remote village in A.P. installs a digital wallet on his first smartphone, and someone from the International Space Station sends him bitcoins! All this with no government intervention, and no fees to banks.', 'What the bitcoin revolution showcased was that pioneers who mined and cached hundreds of bitcoins found themselves to be millionaires towards late 2013 when the cost of one coin hit 1000$ (it’s been steady at 800$ for the past few weeks). Bitcoins are now being rapidly adopted by merchants all over the world. Bitcoin ATMs are cropping up at airports. And rumors are that Amazon might be considering accepting bitcoins as a form of payment. It’s only a matter of time before Word stops putting a red squiggly line under the word bitcoin!', 'Dogecoin was borne out of a joke. While the maximum number of bitcoins there ever will be is 21 million, the maximum number of dogecoins was hardwired to be 100 billion! With that many coins, the difficulty stays low for longer, allowing solo miners to gain coins easily for longer. The goal was to create a currency like bitcoin, but only more accessible so that people could have fun with it. It started as a way to tip comments on reddit, but soon evolved to take on more real-world issues.', 'Just as how a good camera does not necessarily make a great photographer, a successful virtual currency is only as good as the people using them. The dogecoin enthusiasts are famous for their helpful and playful nature, encouraging the uninitiated to study the protocol, and tipping generously to instill a sense of camaraderie.', 'If only people adopted this attitude in the real world, it would be a nicer place to live. For now, the shibes are reveling in the fact that Shiva Keshavan got to go to Sochi.', 'In the video below, Shiva Keshavan speaks to the Athlete Profiles series about his journey in the Luge event from practicing on the highways of the Himalayas to competing in the Winter Olympic Games.

On reaching Sochi, Keshavan and Namita found that the Indian government had decided to fund the luge team in its entirety. Perhaps, it was due to the moral compunctions of some official or maybe because of the international attention during an election year. Whatever be the reason, the news is that the Indian luge athletes didn’t have to worry about the money.', 'Keshavan took the time to thank the dogecoin community with the following message:', 'We want to thank all of you for your generosity and support. I and two other athletes from India will be competing as Independents due to the suspension of the Indian Olympic Association for non-compliance with the Olympic Charter, in particular the Ethics Clause that requires office bearers charged with corruption to step down from office. As the National Olympic Committee stands suspended, the Ministry of Sports (Government of India) has agreed to bear the cost of travel of all Indian Athletes and support staff to Sochi. The Government has also paid for the equipment of the skiers. Although I am very grateful and humbled by your generosity, I cannot accept funds for costs that have already been paid. I would like to see the funds you raised be used for a good cause. After speaking with the Dogecoin Foundation, we have decided to support two causes important to us and currently promoted by the Foundation: children and animals, by having the funds raised for the travel costs go towards to the Doge 4 Kids campaign.', 'We are very busy during the Olympics, but afterwards we would be interested in sharing more with you about the charitable work we are doing in India with children and sports.

14,-2014-2-page-3-,"['Archives', 'How Sudha and Bhuvan Gunavante Used Rainwater Harvesting to Break a Centuries-old Curse in Uttarakhand']","['\n\n\nby\n\nChicu Lokgariwar\n\n\nFebruary 6, 2014, 2:45 pm \n\n\n', 'A small village in Uttarakhand stands testimony to the fact that rooftop rainwater harvesting is a reliable, economical and logical way of ensuring self-sufficiency and dignity.', 'Sudha Gunavante is a contented woman. She has reason to be. After all, she and her husband have managed to prosper on their farm, her children are well-educated and well-settled, and her rhododendron syrup is the pride of the village. If that is not enough, she has also managed to escape a centuries-old curse.', 'Sudha and her husband live in Gauna, a small village in Lamgarah tehsil of Almora district in Uttarakhand. It was to this village that long ago, a sadhu arrived. He asked a householder for a drink of water but was refused this hospitality. Angered by this, he cursed the village that all its water sources would dry up and the village would not have any more water. When Sudha got married and came here some 30 years ago, the village was still curse-stricken.', 'The nearest source of water was a spring at the bottom of the mountain on which the village was located – a very steep 3km walk down, and the same steep 3km walk uphill with water-laden pots. There was more to the story. Water at this spring was limited. In the summer if she were unfortunate enough to arrive late, the stored water would be over and she would have to wait for half a day for the spring to replenish itself. To avoid this, she used to go to the spring at 3am, expecting a leopard to leap onto her back any moment. The three pots of water that were allowed per household needed to last her for drinking, washing and all possible domestic uses. There was no question of irrigation at all. Cattle needed to be driven far away till they found a watering hole with sufficient water to quench their thirst.', 'Since 2003, there has been a huge change in her life. No longer does she make that arduous and frightening trip down a mountain in the middle of the night. No longer does her entire day go in merely carrying water. No longer are she and her husband at the mercy of the rain. They now practice protective irrigation, start their seedlings before the monsoon, and cultivate exotic, high value crops like the Kiwi fruit. She is a member of a self-help group that manufactures and sells rhododendron syrup. So what happened in 2003?', 'Sudha and Bhuvan Gunavante began to harvest rainwater.', 'Like many other people in their village, Sudha and Bhuvan Gunavante follow two approaches to harvesting rainwater. One of these is harvesting rooftop rainwater. The other is harvesting surface runoff.', 'Rooftop rainwater harvesting collects water from the roof, through a system of horizontal channels and vertical down-take pipes and carries it to a closed tank. Water is stored here, close to the house and can be used for drinking and other domestic purposes. These tanks can be built of several suitable materials. The tanks at Gauna, partly funded through a project initiated by the Central Himalayan Environment Association (CHEA), an NGO that focuses on water management and improving livelihoods of people in the mountain states, were built of brick and plastered externally and internally.', 'Other villages in the area are following suit as well. Duarab is a village in Nainital district that prides itself on cultivating organic vegetables. Here too, nearly every roof has its downtake leading to a storage tank. However, the villagers have chosen to continue to use the spring water rather than the rainwater for drinking. Why? Because the precious rainwater is reserved for watering seedlings. This enables them to raise vegetable plants well before the monsoon, thus ensuring that the vegetables they produce receive the high prices possible early in the season.', 'Harvesting surface runoff involves channelling the water that runs across the land and diverting it into an open tank. These tanks are constructed by the villagers. First a rectangular pit- the size may vary according to the amount of water it will receive and the land available – is dug. The surface is made smooth with a mixture of clay and cow dung. A plastic sheet is laid over this. Finally, a dry stone wall is built to protect this sheet.', 'Such a tank, if de-silted and maintained well can last for decades. These are mainly used for irrigation and for livestock. The popularity of these tanks proves their efficacy. Bhuvan Gunavante started with 2 tanks in 2003; a decade later, he boasts of 10 tanks on his land. There are 155 such rainwater harvesting tanks in Gauna and its neighbouring villages.', 'How much water can a roof yield? Quite a lot. Let us assume that the size of a roof is 6m X 4m (a conservative estimate). In a normal year, which receives an average rainfall of 1500mm, an astounding 36 cubic metres or 36 thousand litres of water rolls down it. However, not all this water can be collected and stored. Water from the first rains is allowed to flow away. This process known as the first flush cleans the roof. It is generally estimated that 80% of the rain that falls on a rooftop can be harvested. This means that about 29,000 litres can be harvested from the rooftop in our example. Averaging out 40 litres per person per day to be an adequate amount of water for a person in a rural area, these 29,000 liters will suffice a couple like Sudha and Bhuvan for 363 days – or almost the entire year!', 'Ideally, a tank would store enough water to tide one over 3 months. In the case of Sudha and Bhuvan, this would store about 14,500 litres of water. However, it is not necessary to be so meticulous about this. Building a tank depending upon the space that a family can afford to allot to it, is still far more useful than not building one at all. The tanks designed to capture surface runoff too, can be aligned as per land availability. Water can be harvested from nearly every type of roof – from tin, slate and mud. In case of the latter, installation of a filter is necessary before rainwater enters the tank.', 'The biggest beneficiaries of the rainwater harvesting initiative are the women of these villages. No longer do they have to make the arduous trek in order to fetch water. Not only has it reduced drudgery, but also prevented water conflicts, opened up means of livelihood generation and made agriculture profitable again.', 'For the villagers of Gauna and Duarab, the installation of rooftop rainwater harvesting tanks is now the norm. This needs to be the case in every house in the Himalayan region, not to mention in the rest of India. Rooftop rainwater harvesting is an assured, reliable, economical and logical way of ensuring a certain level of self-sufficiency and dignity. By giving each household control over its water source, rainwater harvesting illustrates decentralization at its best. This needs to be an integral part of our rural development model.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Here is an organization that is working to spread awareness about the process and helping more deserving candidates from Economically Weaker Sections of the society get their seats in private schools. And\xa0if you know of any such deserving students, here’s what you can do!', 'A team of field coordinators in Andhra Pradesh asked 45 scholarship children a simple question – “What is the farthest place you know that you would like to go to?” These children aged between 10 to 12 years were from low-income families across five districts in Andhra Pradesh. Except for five students who named Mumbai, Kolkata, Mecca, Kuwait, and London, everybody else named a place within their district or state. Children’s “capacity to aspire” seems constrained by early family and schooling experiences.', 'The Supreme Court’s April 2012 mandate of upholding RTE Clause 12, which mandates 25 percent of entering class seats be made available for ‘weak’ and ‘disadvantaged children’, provides an opportunity to bridge the growing rich-poor private schooling divide. Giving our children a chance to integrate with children from other social groups might influence among many things, their “capacity to aspire.” This video illustrates this fact: (If you cannot view the video here, please click on this link to watch it on Youtube).', 'Unfortunately, the pathways to entry into private schools are not straight-forward for families from Economically Weaker Sections (EWS). Only 5 percent of the 80 EWS families at the end of five years had awareness about Clause 12 in Andhra Pradesh. Access to information regarding the scholarship opportunity, data proves, is the first barrier to entry. Section 12 of the Right to Education, estimates show, has the potential of reaching 2 lakh children in Delhi in the next 5 years and cumulatively 10 million children across the country. Published reports of dismal awareness threatened to derail this progressive provision.', 'To urgently resolve this information gulf, a few Harvard and MIT alumni got together to conceive the idea of INDUS ACTION. Coming together in August 2013, the diverse backgrounds of the founding team of INDUS ACTION converged at their conviction for equal opportunities for all irrespective of socio-economic standing. Aniket Doegar, a commerce graduate, pursued the Teach for India fellowship and worked on school management committees in Pune. Debanshu Roy has a degree in medicine, research experience in designing public health projects and was a 2012 Young India Fellow. Richa Hingorani, a mass communication graduate has worked with NDTV and went on to manage media and communications for the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA).', 'Project Eklavya, the premier project of INDUS ACTION was designed to provide a solution to the government and the society at large to implement section 12 effectively in Delhi to begin with and scale it gradually pan India. With diverse backgrounds, a team of 4 young people joined hands together to pull off the execution of their pilot project in South Delhi. Their baseline survey revealed that only 3% of the eligible families were aware of Section 12 and less than a percent knew about the documents required.', 'With these stats and preliminary groundwork, a toll-free helpline was started with the idea that since most of the beneficiaries themselves might have limited literacy, easy access to a person who can walk them through their anxieties might be a more effective intervention than handing over a piece of paper with bulleted information. Our managers receive several calls a day ranging from enthusiastic admission queries for two-year-old kids to confusion resolution between a “janm patri”(birth certificate) and “kundali”(horoscope). As the timeline proceeded from December, through January, the calls transitioned from queries, to complaints about private schools, which now, being overwhelmed by applications, were looking for ways to contain them. What remained constant was the faith that they had on the organization to provide support. What evolved were their aspirations and their hope for a better opportunity.', 'Leveraging existing institutions and connecting the dots within existing service delivery structures was the strategy that was followed. In its first year, Project Eklavya bagged two key partnerships with government institutions – Mission Convergence and Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), Ministry of Women & Child Development. Mission Convergence aims to make Delhi a more inclusive city by integrating the existing social security schemes and delivering them through a unified structure in a decentralized manner. Operating Gender Resource Centres (GRCs) in vulnerable communities, Mission Convergence has created information hot spots for effective dissemination about government-related schemes. INDUS ACTION partnered with GRCs in South district of New Delhi to generate information about Section 12 of the Right to Education. Each of the 10 GRCs in the aforementioned district have INDUS ACTION volunteers providing form-filling support, clarifying doubts and providing a list of neighboring private schools for eligible families.', 'Furthermore, their partnership with the Ministry of Women & Child Development gave them access to 19 Anganwadis in South Delhi. Anganwadis provide basic pre-school education and act as mother & child care centres. As such, these centres act as the feeder groups for their targeted interventions with eligible and motivated families. By their estimates, their on-ground team of 45 volunteers will help complete and submit 1000 unique applications for this admission cycle.', 'INDUS ACTION firmly believes that education is an opportunity that should not be determined by birth. Every child deserves an opportunity for education irrespective of his or her socio-economic status. Their efforts need to be supported by yours! You can help enable an opportunity for education by sparing 2 minutes of your time. Ask your house help, driver and other service provides (milkman, washer-man) if:', '1.

If they belong to SC/ST/OBC (non-creamy layer) then a caste certificate issued in Delhi needs to be annexed with the form. Socially disadvantaged groups are ONLY required to submit a caste certificate and NOT an income certificate.', 'Earlier on, all copies of certificates needed to be attested by a gazetted officer. Their interactions with parents and complaints on the helpline showed that this was fast emerging as a barrier. Taking cognizance, the Directorate of Education asked all schools to accept self-attested copies of certificates.', 'With the process now simplified, you can help by holding meetings in RWAs, relaying the helpline number (1800-419-1019; 9am-6pm) to those who may fulfill the criteria.', 'Two minutes worth of your time could translate into a colossal change in the life of a family.
