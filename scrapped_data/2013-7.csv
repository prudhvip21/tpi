It is indeed difficult to believe that the farm which is now full of vegetation, tall green grass, cashew nut trees, coconut, pepper, pineapples, areca nut, banana, was once a barren land without water. The two borewells and the three open wells in the farm are now full of water.', 'The story of how this barren piece of land was transformed into a self sufficient farm dates back to 1987. Richard Rebello acquired this land from a doctor who was keen to sell off this land as it had been written off as useless and uncultivable because of lack of water and the hard laterite rock which makes it very difficult to hold water.', 'It all started when the doctor approached Richard Rebello for help to sell off the farm and found that lack of water chased off future customers. After seeing the doctor’s frustration, Richard Rebello decided to step in to help and decided to buy the farm himself. The land was in very poor condition then. Around 20 percent of it was very hard laterite where no crops could be grown. The very few coconut trees that the land had, had also withered off because of the lack of water.', 'Richard Rebello decided to take it up as a challenge and thus started his quest for finding solutions to solve the water problems of the land. Richard Rebello travelled to many places in the Dakshin Kannada district and Kerala in search of solutions. The only solution he was offered was that of mulching, which had been successfully used in rubber plantations on the hill tops.', 'He began experimenting and implementing his ideas by starting with mulching of coconut trees with green and dry leaves. The other idea he started implementing was to dig pits and deep trenches in the soil in his land at regular intervals to direct the flow of rainwater from the slopes into the trenches. He continued the process of digging new pits and trenches and also de-silting the older ones.', 'My basic aim in doing this was to catch all the water following the heavy rains that we have in this part of the country, which is normally wasted because of the hard laterite structures and the location of the farm on a hilltop. I take care to see that not a single drop of water is wasted.', 'He shows us the trenches made on the sloping roads that allow the water to flow inside the farm to percolate in the soil. We also have a look at a huge rain pond dug to collect run-off water from about 10-15 acres, which has a capacity of 10 lakh litres.', 'He shows us the new pits and trenches that he continues to make in his farm to catch the runoff and help in percolation of water. “Even mulching helps to prevent evaporation of water”, he says. “I have been doing this for the last 24 years and have gone step by step to get results. No land should be left fallow”, he says and shows us some patches of thick vegetation on the farms. “It is important to have thick plantations in some places to prevent evaporation of water and also prevent erosion of the soil,” he informs.', 'Besides growing fruits and vegetables, Richard Rebello’s farm also includes a poultry that breeds broiler chicken and a dairy, both helping his farm by providing manure thus making it self sufficient. The yield from his farm now includes coconuts, pineapples, bananas, besides cashews and pepper that provide him a considerable amount of profit and that too from a land that was written off as barren a few years back!', 'Richard Rebello points at a place on the slope below his land at the overgrown bushes and informs that this was once a madaka, a traditional water harvesting structure, which continues to be ignored and crores of rupees are spent on projects to procure water in the area, which are wasted. “The only thing that needs to be done is to scoop out the mud from the madaka and it will still be full of water”, he adds.', 'What is important is for people to understand the importance of utilising all the rainwater that is available, we have traditional methods to do so as well. Earlier, people at the village level built check dams, bunds to take care of their water needs. The mentality that the government should do everything for us spoilt this and these efforts at the local level were replaced by huge structures such as dams.', '“However, this cannot be the solution everywhere. What is important is to try out your own ways of finding solutions to the water problems by looking at what our ancestors did. It is sad that we do not give importance to rainwater harvesting and to see that the traditional rainwater harvesting structures such as the madaka continue to be ignored.', '“Many a times solutions do exist, what is important is to have the will and the determination to pursue them till the end!” he adds as we return to his small house in the farm to drink coconut water and taste the fruits, taking in the scenic beauty, impressed by his simplicity and determination to go on!', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

The idea of harnessing the power of gated communities may not seem like much, but the change it has brought in the lives of 1000-odd families in this apartment complex is indeed remarkable.', 'A bunch of enthusiasts started a group called Community Catalysts a few months ago. These members live in a gated community called Serene County, Hyderabad. Together, they have been working towards bringing about a positive change in every resident’s outlook, making them aware about social causes and their responsibilities. The primary motto of this band of people is that it is a great mistake to do nothing just because you can only do a little.', 'Still in their nascent stage, the group has managed to have a few successful initiatives like kitchen waste recycling, better roads to the apartment complex, a successful voter-id card drive, women empowerment etc. Dry waste donation and recycling camps are held every month with the help of YouSee and school supply and clothes donation in association with Goonj.', 'Organic Composting and Waste Segregation\nSerene County, by virtue of having over 1000 families in residence and being surrounded by lush landscaped gardens, produces several hundred kilos of kitchen and garden waste. The aim was to promote waste segregation at its source, that is, in homes and utilise this waste and turn it into compost that can be used in the community gardens. A Compost Center was setup with the help of social entrepreneur YOUSEE where kitchen waste from homes and garden waste from surroundings is collected and turned into compost.', 'Most people know about the advantage of waste management, but they either do not know how to go about it, or they do not have the time to follow it through. Keeping this in mind, the volunteers conceptualised and motivated residents to contribute to their Compost Center. A unique system of waste collection was put in place that is hassle free and simple enough for most people to follow.', 'This is a beginning towards making a collective impact towards environment conservation. By segregating waste and promoting recycling, the community has taken up its responsibility towards reducing waste that gets dumped in landfills.', 'Voter ID Card Drive\nMost of the people have to settle at different places for better employment .This is true for many of Serene County’s residents as they do not belong to Hyderabad. Most of them do not have voter ID card, or if they have, it is of their native place. Community Catalysts, along with LetsVote NGO (a non-profit non-political organisation) worked towards achieving a 100% voter registration and 100% voting from the community.', 'Presently they have reached almost 100% voter ID registration (using “almost” as people have applied but getting physical voter ID card takes time). They used different ways to reach this goal – by door to door campaigning, arranging a Voter ID camp, providing simple steps to apply for voter ID, solving people’s queries by following up with the Election Commission office and motivating them to be responsible citizens and exercise an important constitutional right.', 'They believe that two major obstacles to bring change in our country are\n– Majority of people who are aware of issues don’t Vote\n– Majority of people who do vote are unaware of the issues.', 'The second part is difficult to achieve but the first part is quite easy, only people perceive it as difficult. The Community Catalyst team wanted to help the community to get the power of democracy by having voter ID card.', 'Better Roads Initiative\nThe approach road to Serene County was full of pits. It was especially dangerous for two-wheelers. The volunteers from Community Catalysst took it upon themselves to resolve the issue. They filled the pits with sand themselves as a temporary mitigating measure. Then, they approached the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) where an officer guided them to appeal to the APIIC and gave them the contact number of the concerned person. Very soon, the pits were covered and the road was levelled.', 'The usual thought process is that approaching a government body in order to get work done is pretty much a waste of time. This is not always true.

3,2013-7,"['Archives', 'TBI Innovations: ‘Anandi’ Pads – A Creative And Eco-friendly Solution To An Age-Old Taboo']","['It is unfortunate that the normal human procedure of menstruation has been regarded as ‘impure’ and considered taboo for generations of Indians. However, things are changing now, and it is hearty to know that India is at the forefront of disruptive innovations in menstrual hygiene. Here we bring you a ‘Bong’ duo doing fabulous work in breaking stereotypes and creating a sanitary revolution.', 'That ‘time of the month’ – for most urban women in this country it amounts to minor discomfort and a rather welcome excuse to consume chocolate. I had never really paid much attention to the fact that menstruation drastically affects the lives of millions of women across rural India every single month. That’s until I found myself, as part of my training under the ICICI Fellowship, with my period in Dhoan – a little village nestled in the Western Ghats and 3 hours away from the closest town or district headquarters.', 'My search for menstrual hygiene products at the time opened my eyes to the reality of the 300 million women in India who do not use sanitary napkins during menstruation – that’s more than the entire female population of 27 European Union countries (255 million) and almost the total population of the United States (311 million). The reasons for this dire situation are a lack of awareness, availability, and affordability; not to mention issues that arise with disposal (AC Nielson report, 2011). All of these are coupled with the cultural taboo attached to menstruation in our country where menstruating women are considered to be ‘impure’.', 'In the absence of menstrual hygiene products, women and adolescent girls in this country make use of dirty rags, bark, ash and mud instead. This abysmal dearth of menstrual hygiene translates into a loss of 5 years of work days over a lifetime and is a leading cause for the 23 percent school dropout rate among pubescent girls.', 'However, hoping to change this situation are the very Bong duo of Jaydeep Mandal and Sombodhi Ghosh – the founders of Aakar Innovations – who have developed a low-cost sanitary napkin manufacturing machine that produces bio-degradable pulp fibre sanitary napkins comparable in quality to MNC products.', 'Aakar is a platform integrator where, through the setting up of sanitary napkin production units, it offers livelihood opportunities to rural women and also creates sales and distribution models through village-level women entrepreneurs. The Aakar model thereby addresses 6 of the 8 Millennium Development Goals i.e. MDG 1,2,3,5,7 and 8.', 'The Beginnings:\nDespite being initially hesitant to work on an issue seen intrinsically as a ‘female problem’, Jaydeep and Sombodhi, realising the scope of the problem, were determined to find solutions. Sombodhi says:', 'When we first thought of starting Aakar everyone told us we were out of our minds. How could two men work on such a sensitive issue, especially when we will never experience the problems and discomfort for ourselves? Also in the Indian society menstrual hygiene is an extremely difficult topic to broach – even doctors find it uncomfortable to talk about! All of this bolstered us to face these challenges head on and to experiment and arrive at a lasting viable solution.', 'They were inspired by India’s very own ‘sanitary pad man’ Arunachalam Muruganantham, and supported by Prof. Anil Gupta and the National Innovation Foundation (NIF). Collaborating with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and NIF, after several rounds of experimentation they devised a machine which manufactures bio-degradable sanitary napkins using agri-wastes such as banana fiber, bagasse, bamboo and water hyacinth as raw materials.', 'At just Rs. 2 per napkin; the sanitary napkins marketed under the brand name ‘Anandi’ (meaning joy and happiness) are available at a price point 40% lower than the lowest market competitor. These napkins are UV rays sterilized and adhere to BIS standards for sanitary napkins, making them an ideal and reliable solution to the current unhygienic alternatives that women and pubescent girls in the country resort to.', 'Growth and Support:\nAakar successfully pilot-tested its model in Uttarakhand, providing employment opportunities to 32 village level women entrepreneurs and creating access to menstrual hygiene products for 3000 women. Based on the success of its pilot, the Gujarat Livelihood Promotion Ltd (Govt of Gujarat) signed an MOU with Aakar in early 2013 to enable them to scale up their technology across Gujarat.', 'The Millennium Alliance; a joint initiative by FICCI, the Department of Science and Technology (GOI) and USAID have recommended Aakar Innovations as one of the top five Indian innovations in the family planning and reproductive health sector. Its biodegradable fibre technology has been recognised as one of the top three innovations in the DST Lockheed Martin India Innovation Growth Programme 2013.', 'Aakar is also supported by the Centre for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship (CIIE) at IIM Ahmedabad.', 'Challenges: \nHowever, despite the current recognition coming its way, the going was tough for Aakar in its early days. The enterprise, in the course of piloting various innovations, found itself almost at the brink of bankruptcy. A small loan by NIF through its Micro Venture Innovation fund in 2010 allowed it to tide over this period and set up a small unit in Khatima, Uttarakhand.', 'Aakar’s experience in Uttarakhand taught them many lessons, foremost among them being the need to critically work on empowering women and creating community awareness regarding menstruation and menstrual hygiene. Both Jaydeep and Sombodhi believed that for the women in these communities to accept and adopt ‘Anandi’ pads, the communities they were a part of needed to embrace gender equality – and that this cannot be done if women and girls who are at the core of these communities are ostracised for a week every month.', 'While hoping to learn of the expectations of women and girls regarding menstrual hygiene products and to get their feedback on ‘Anandi’ pads, Aakar’s founders found that creating community awareness was the key as no awareness of this kind of product even existed in these communities. They sought the help of community doctors, key influencers in the community as well as developed champions out of women from the community. These even went on to become mascots of ‘Anandi’ pads in these communities.', 'According to Shashank Rastogi, Director, Aarohan Ventures – CIIE:', 'Aakar is one of the rare social enterprises leveraging lean startup techniques to come up with better solutions. Through an iterative process of product testing, customer feedback assimilation and refinement, Aakar is creating apt solutions to address one of India’s key development challenges.', 'Today, the founders of Aakar find themselves on the threshold of setting up their first commercial unit in their home state at Behrampore in West Bengal.', 'Over the next five years, Aakar looks to expand operations to Afghanistan, Philippines and other countries in south-east Asia and Africa, catering to the needs of 6 million women while directly employing 11,000 women. It hopes to resist 720,000 school dropouts, recover 370 million working days and prevent 40,000 maternal deaths.

With the help of an organization, many of these women now have the opportunity to put this skill to good use and generate additional household income. This is empowering them in ways unthinkable a few years ago, and changing the very fabric of their lives.', 'The garments and artefacts catch the eye as they hang in the Sadhna showroom in the old Udaipur locality of Fatehpura – ‘dupattas’ of every hue, ‘kurtas’ for every size, soft quilts and coverlets made of the finest cotton, handicrafts fashioned out of cloth. Look at the products more closely and the simple, fine hand work that has gone into them becomes apparent. Tiny running stitches embellish the yoke of a ‘kurti’, colourful appliqué work runs along the length of a ‘dupatta’, painstaking patchwork animates a quilt. Whose hands have plied the needle to create these objects of beauty and comfort? Behind that question lies a tale of hard work, entrepreneurship and institution building.', 'Leela Vijaynergia, chief executive of Sadhna, traces its evolution:', 'The year 1988 was a period of great distress in Rajasthan because of persistent drought. The men had migrated for work but often couldn’t send enough money home and the women left behind were desperate to make a little extra to keep their families going. That was why Seva Mandir, the Udaipur-based voluntary organisation working on social issues, thought of providing an income-generating programme for women. It was called the Patchwork Programme because much of the work centred on patchwork.', 'That first group comprised 15 women, some of whom had earlier worked as manual scavengers. Today, that group has evolved into a mutual benefit trust called Sadhna and currently represents 700 women artisans in 16 urban, peri-urban and rural locations in the Rajasthan districts of Udaipur and Rajsamand. Each artisan is an owner member of the organisation, participating in its decision-making process through a representative. Their husbands are farm workers or migrants who drive rickshaws or do plumbing, painting and masonry work in the cities and often the women themselves are farm workers.', 'Sadhna’s products reflect the age-old traditions of local women. They may not have much formal education but the one skill they possessed is sewing. Priya Khan, Social Manager, Sadhna, explains, “Traditionally, quilting and the running stitch was very much a part of the domestic scene in these parts. ‘Razais’ (Quilts), bedcovers, ‘dupattas’ and other household knick-knacks were made from old cloth placed one layer over the other and stitched together. We built on that base. Every Sadhna member first undergoes a three-month training programme. Improvised methods were used to train them, for instance the distance between one row and the other is often measured by using the span of four fingers. Over the training period they learn to use finer, neater stitches for a better finish.”', 'But tradition had to combine with modernity because Sadhna’s products cater to the urban market. “What we chose to develop was also based on the consideration that since Udaipur is a centre for tourism there is scope to add value to local products and sell them. Today, all our work revolves around three crafts – the running stitch, appliqué work and patchwork, using natural fibres as well as natural dyes. But we also take orders, and sometimes these are for synthetics,”', 'As the institution changed, so did the women. Manjula Singh, Design Executive, Sadhna, recalls how, in the early days, the women artisans hid themselves behind their saris and would not step out of their homes.', 'But as they earned their own money and interacted with others, as their status within the family grew because of the income they brought in, they themselves got transformed. Earnings are linked to output, which in turn is related to the time the women can spare for sewing – some make Rs 5,000 a month, others barely Rs 200.', 'Nowadays, some artisans ride scooters and report that their husbands help them with household chores – something that was unthinkable earlier! They have also learnt to operate their own bank accounts and participate in exhibitions during which they are required to handle material worth lakhs of rupees, all the while keeping accounts scrupulously. On a couple of occasions, Sadhna’s artisans have even participated in fashion shows to showcase their garments, and have done this with the panache of true runway ‘ranis’!', '“We have tried to make this organisation as representative as possible,” states Vijaynergia. In order to do this, Sadhna’s 700 women artisans are divided into 49 groups, each of which has a leader, who functions as the interface between the artisans and the organisation. These leaders – rotated every three years – are part of the organisation’s management committee and participate in the decision-making process. They also ensure that the material to be sewn reaches the women in the community.', 'Stitch by stitch, as the organisation grew, it ensured that norms were followed – including the strict ban on child labour. Most of the artisans are between the ages of 25 to 40, although the older ones could be anywhere between 55 and 60. In 2011-2012, Sadhna had a sales figure of Rs 3.35 crore, with 60 per cent of all profits going to the artisans directly.', 'While Sadhna’s head office is in Udaipur – 250 of its members are located there – it has an equally large presence in the attractive heritage town of Dilwara, in Rajsamand district, which is about 25 kilometres from Udaipur city. Sadhna has now set up a common facility centre here where trainings and meetings are regularly held.', 'Visit Dilwara around mid-day and chances are that you will find many women sitting in the courtyards of their homes, plying their needle. Just like Sita Devi, 38, mother of two girls and a boy, who lives a few streets away from Dilwara’s famous 450-year-old Jain temple complex. She, along with her sister-in-law, Sangeeta, sit together, tracing chalk lines made on pieces of ochre cloth with a fine running stitch, even as Sangeeta’s eight-month-old toddler mewls and cooes in one corner of the courtyard.', '“I sit down to my work after the morning chores are done – usually around 10 am. Our leader is Laxmi and she brings us work. I work for six to seven hours a day – not at a stretch but off and on, as time permits,” reveals Sita.', 'Earlier she was very dependent on the money that her husband, an autorickshaw driver in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, used to send. Not anymore. Last month, for instance, she received a sum of Rs 5,970 in her bank account, thanks to the Sadhna work. The money is useful to cope with everyday expenses like the children’s schooling. “There are always needs to be met,” says Sita. “Recently, I got my elder daughter married. Now I want to build two extra rooms in my home and this money will help.”', 'Accidents sometimes happen. Sangeeta reports how a cow once chewed on a piece of cloth she was working on which led to the loss of a month’s earnings. “Now, of course, I am very careful and keep the work away from stray animals and children!” she smiles. There are also occupational hazards associated with sewing, like deteriorating eyesight. Conscious of this aspect, Sadhna provides free spectacles and access to ophthalmic care.', 'Vijaynergia and her colleagues would like to scale up Sadhna’s operations but they have to contend with multiple challenges, ranging from caste and gender barriers to resource constraints and a capricious market in recessionary times. But they are also acutely conscious that income generation is not the only reason for the existence of an organisation like Sadhna – it is also about empowering ordinary women. Women like Sita Devi who, because of her association with Sadhna, can now keep her aspirations alive. Says she,', 'All I have is my needle and my ability to stitch.

We all shed a few tears of empathy watching movies like Dosti, Black, Tarein Zameen Pe; but a few like Swasti Ray actually use that moment to generate an idea for the benefit of these children. This celebrated advertising creative director talks about his initiative ‘eyecan’, which brought art and colours in the life of the visually impaired.', 'It was a usual weekend for Swasti Ray when he observed a visually impaired kid behind her mother trying to feel the shape of an apple near the fruit vendor in Shahpur Jat’s busy lane, which immediately brought a question in his mind, “Will he be able to know the colour as well – ‘red’ – and should we put Braille colour codes on every fruit?” The very thought motivated him to work on something that helps the blind enjoy colours and painting. And thus, ‘eyecan’ came into being.', 'Eyecan’ was conceptualized two years back. It was the time when I realized my skills should go beyond what we call in advertising ‘ye patli gali toh award jeetaga.’ I have to do something real using my academic and professional skills, a complete form of trans-disciplinary art, based on research and technical planning, an idea which would go to small villages and across the country as well. And as I was completely inclined towards the social form of art, I kept my emotional senses always open, which really helped me to come up with the idea of ‘eyecan’. My initial work of developing a basic water painting strip with Braille identifiers (named Colorise) ended in confusion and failure. But with technical inputs from the Vice President of Amar Colony’s Institution for the Blind and Helen Keller Institute for Deaf & Blind (Mumbai), I was able to adapt a Japanese colouring device ‘Mitsuro Pen’ (an electronic device which is heavy in weight and uses wax strips to melt as wax ink) into ‘eyecan ’pastels which are being used by the visually impaired in India for realizing their ART dreams.', 'All this has not been easy; Swasti went to Japan to tap into the global learning of educating visually impaired and their prospects. One of his good artist friends from Japan, MiranRin, introduced him to Chiba School of Blind, Tokyo and he was called to do a small workshop using the Japanese ‘Mitsuro Pen’.', 'Japan was a great help for me in terms of learning all the emotional and functional aspects of teaching the blind, to technically enhancing the product. In my initial days of research, I also came up with an idea of using mess net drawing boards. I always had in my mind ‘Simple-mass produce-spread across’. I fully used my Japanese experiences to get the best use of my product. The continuous weekend classes were really fruitful. ‘eyecan’ now was not just a project or workshop. It was proved as a revolution.', 'These art workshops with the visually impaired have been the best moments for Swasti. He has been touched by the innovative and imaginative sense of these children.', 'Their eyes always wait for someone they could see, all the innocent questions will make you think about what it feels like being blind oneself. They learn and adapt very fast, their sensation of touch and imagination is far superior to be called as super-enabled. It took me just two classes to make them realize what wonders they can do. I gave them examples of legendary blind artist Eseref from Turkey as well as the process of exploring their imagination.', 'Swasti’s joys and involvement multiplied with each workshop and by the end of November 2012, he had planned organizing an art exhibition to showcase the brilliant work the students had done. Everyone from his clients to his advertising company (JWT) including Gallery Art Eterne came forward to support him. Shivani Bharatwaj, a senior artist from Delhi joined the cause by teaching the children on week days as well. Finally on February 21st, 2013, they did something unimaginable – an art exhibition by blind students!', 'Apart from great response from children & audiences, the biggest incident which touched me emotionally, happened on the 2nd day of our exhibition. A lady with her visually impaired daughter (aged 20) came to me asking “I saw your article in Hindustan Times; can my daughter paint as well?” She was not the only one, many parents came to me asking if their kids could draw and tested the instrument there. It was the biggest reward of making ‘eyecan’, there I felt the power of media making a small pastel approach many emotions. Can you imagine a visually impaired child, Umesh, was the centre of all attention as he had made a portrait of Dr. Manmohan Singh! We still have that work to gift it to our PM as it’s a message to him from Umesh.', 'This is great, but at this point we all must be wondering “How can the blind see colour”? Swasti’s device (pastel & drawing board) is the answer itself – “feeling is viewing”. For these children, the sensation of touch converts the shape, size, dimensions and perspective as well into a form of imaginative drawings in mind and then they are able to express it in their own way by the use of Braille coded pastels over mess textured board. The best thing was the students themselves were feeling their painting.', 'People like Swasti really take art beyond all limitations, and humanity beyond all imperfections!', 'I think every individual has to do his bit. We in India devote/indulge most of our time and money to what we call ‘GOD’. We can spend a million rupees to put our children in a good B-school but we can’t pay a thousand rupees to sponsor a poor kid’s monthly education. It’s not a responsibility; it’s a necessity for being a human to know a human. I would say disabled are those who can’t help others! And the solution is simple – be one of them and think.', 'Swasti’s passion and persistence have earned him many laurels. He was invited on the occasion of World Peace day by GEOC (Global Environment Outstretch Centre) in the Tokyo UN building to host an exhibition of selected work by the Chiba School of Blind.

Nestled among the landscaped villas and high rise apartments of South City 2, Gurgaon, BAGIYA is one such school. Housed in the basement of a residential building, Bagiya educates the children of construction site workers.', 'Founded in 2007 by Shilpa Sonal, Bagiya “mainstreams” at least 50 such children every year, meaning that 50 under-privileged children from Bagiya enter mainstream schools such as DPS, Pallavanjali and Shikshaantar. Sports and extra-curricular activities too get attention, and Bagiya ties up with sports academies and other such activity centres depending upon the aptitude of particular students. Doctors, artists, and sportspersons too volunteer their services, sometimes for a week or a month.', 'With a team of 20 volunteers,some of whom travel long distances to reach the school, Shilpa Sonal now dreams of opening a Bagiya in each of the many villages located in and around Gurgaon. Also on the anvil are vocational training centres in these villages, with the objective of improving educational infrastructure in the centres of neglect that abound in the Millennium City. Shilpa Sonal is confident that as they proceed with focus and dedication, she and her team of volunteers will make a tangible difference to the lives of those to whom they will bring schooling and vocational training.', 'TBI guest writer, Priya VK Singh, interviewed Shilpa Sonal to find out what motivates her to run the school and how she has managed to achieve all that she has in a span of six short years.', 'Shilpa, what accounts for your involvement with the school?\nWhile my husband was serving the Special Forces in the Indian Army . I worked for the welfare of the ladies and families of the Jawans fighting at the borders in remote areas of Ladakh. This was both a very humbling experience and educative as well. Later, after my husband took an early retirement from the Army, I got involved in getting our dhobi’s 3-year old son operated for a life-saving open heart surgery. This, to my mind, was my moment of truth! To see the boy absolutely normal and healthy is a pleasure inexpressible in words.', 'Did you always want to do this, or was it something that just happened?\nYes, definitely since the time I got married to the Army life and saw how selflessly our Jawans fight for the country. Our country needs great many benefactors to help the less privileged come forward!', 'How many years have you been involved with Bagiya, and in what capacity?\nIts been six years since I began as a volunteer for the service of society. Later, one realized the need to structure the social initiatives and hence the umbrella of Sanshil Foundation for Welfare was founded by me as a non-profit organization in 2009.', 'Has the school grown during these years?\nFrom 6 children from nearby construction sites in my front lawns, today, we have today 200+ children going through a literacy program at Project BAGIYA – A school for underprivileged children. We take immense pride in sharing that we have already mainstreamed 120 children in schools like DPS Shiksha Kenra, Shikshantar, Pallavanjali, CD Sr secondary school etc. These children continue to be hand-held by us and we partly or fully sponsor their education as well.', 'Are there other projects that you have undertaken?\nA stitching centre for women in Jharsa Village, Gurgaon for the past three years is the ideal example of how villages continue to be nestled in concrete jungles of development but have no room for individual growth of the villagers. Products made at Sanshil Stitching centre are being bought by corporates like Kuoni Destination for their tourists from Europe. Sanshil also runs a school for slum children in Sector 30, Noida.', 'Do you find your work satisfying, Shilpa? \nExtremely! What better way to live everyday when someone somewhere can benefit from our efforts? Simply the joy of giving and touching a life! There s no substitute to this joy. Try this sometime.', 'What are the challenges you face? \nSocial initiatives are not always able to get financial support to sustain. Corporate support through CSR is also not always able to match the mission and objectives set out by the NGO/NPO. We at Sanshil Foundation are constantly struggling to meet our needs.', 'What are your plans for the future?\nTo be able to impact as many lives in our own small way. On a micro level, we would like to empower more and more children and young adults from the lower strata via vocational training.', 'What is the impact that your involvement with the school has had on your family, specially your children?\nA lot of personal time is at stake. But I manage my work like a job. After-work hours and weekends are only for the family. On another level, my children have seen me giving my time to benefit another human being. Surprisingly, they have silently observed and understood to manage many things on their own.', 'Are they supportive, proud?\nYes, my parents-in-law who live with us and my husband have always supported my initiatives. Frankly, it would not have been possible without their support.', 'Do your children share your dreams?\nIt is too early to say because my children are still very young, but I am confident they will grow up to be sensitized human beings and will do their bit some day.', 'How can readers help?\nI would request all readers to support any small cause they believe in, or one that touches their hearts. If each one of us does a small good deed, we could make this a happier planet! Some can give their time, some money and some both. Since no organization can sustain itself without support, we need people from society to contribute both. So, one can choose to impact in whatever way comfortable.', 'To know more about the school and the organization that runs it, visit their website: http://www.sanshil.com/Home_Page.html', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

We feature their work here not only to create awareness about the remarkable initiatives undertaken in disaster management but also to encourage them and to express our support and gratitude \xa0for their efforts.', 'The situation in Uttarakhand’s Uttarkashi district, one of the worst affected during the recent floods hasn’t improved even after a fortnight. The villages here are yet to get relief. Whatever little has arrived has been thanks to all the NGOs which have started their relief operations quite sometime ago.', 'The Indian Red Cross Society, a voluntary humanitarian organisation providing relief in times of disasters/emergencies and promoting health and care to the vulnerable people and communities, has set up medical relief camps. It was the first medical responder service through volunteers and is also supplying relief materials such as tents, tarpoline, utensils, stove, blankets and other essentials.', 'As of now the Red Cross Society has given out relief materials to 148 families in villages such as Tilot, Joshiayara and Gyansu. These are villages in the vicinity of the main Uttarkashi town where people have lost their homes and livelihood.', 'The Red Cross Society has surveyed about 12 villages and approximately 650 families have been identified by them who have been affected on the basis of partial loss, full loss and those under potential risk.', '“In some cases even before the disaster we had preempted some villages that will be destroyed and had provided these families with tents and evacuated them to a safer place,” says Dr MK Rao, Secretary, Indian Red Cross Society and retired Deputy Chief Medical Officer-Uttarkashi.', 'The Red Cross Society has been in the field since the disaster struck, that is the 16th of June. The society’s 360 FMRs have also been in the field since then providing medical first aid, providing instant report on how many people are affected and creating awareness programmes with regard to water and sanitation.', 'Since 2002, the Red Cross Society has been working in this region on a regular basis conducting medical camps for the pilgrims.', 'Despite the Red Cross Society having its own team, many local youths from the Uttarkashi district have associated themselves with the Red Cross Society to provide relief. They are largely helping in organizing relief material and making sure it reaches the affected people. Jayprakash Panwar, who runs a trekking company has been helping the Red Cross Society every time a disaster has struck this place. He says:', 'We are residents of Uttarkashi and we want to help our people. We are trained mountaineers and have the necessary skills to reach out to more people.', 'If the youth don’t come forward at such times, when will they come? This is our hometown and the least we can do is help in every which way we can.', 'They also feel that by associating themselves with the Red Cross they can help on a larger scale as it is extremely well-organised and widespread.', 'But is not an easy task to get relief operations conducted here. Says Madhav Prasad Joshi, Treasurer, Indian Red Cross Society, “First and foremost, locating the needy who are affected is becoming a task. Many who have lost their homes have left their villages and relocated themselves to other places. But the biggest challenge is the access to these villages. We have to trek to these villages to give the relief material.” Villagers themselves are trekking up to 20 kms to collect the relief material.', 'Currently, the situation in Uttarkashi is such that people’s hopes are pinned on NGOs because they have been able to reach out to them even before the administration has been able to and have started providing relief materials. Let us hope the situation normalises soon and people are able to carry on with their lives.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
9,2013-7,"['Archives', 'OneChildOneLight – And Then There Was Light…And There Was Education!']","['One of the main obstacles in the path of students in India is the absence of reliable sources of illumination. Electricity is non-existent or at best patchy in most parts of rural India, and other sources of light like the humble kerosene lamps pose health hazards, are ineffective, expensive and unreliable. Read how one organization is dispelling the gloom with a viable alternative.', 'The kerosene lamp is lit as the sun sets. The rising of the narrow flame, as the wick is turned on, is a signal of sorts. It’s a signal for the children that it’s time to study under its scanty light. It is a slim ray of hope to defy darkness, in an ardent attempt to pursue education. The shadows cast by the lamp are way larger than their real objects themselves, just as the problem posed by the kerosene lamps loom larger and more menacing than the seemingly innocuous puffs of smoke and soot particles emitted out of the lamps.', 'Education for all is one of the foremost requirements of our country today. So when a factor like lack of electricity in the remote corners of our country acts as a hindrance towards studying, something must be done. In December 2011, nearly one third of India’s rural population lacked electricity, a loss compensated by burning fossil fuels (kerosene lamps included) to give light. For children in rural areas, the evening time is probably that ‘rush hour’ to study at home, considering the morning and afternoon time is devoted to school, work and household chores. And if this peak study time is deprived of electricity, isn’t that bright dream of seeing Future Generation India educated being dimmed already?', 'The current alternatives: \nThe kerosene lamps cause more harm than good. What seems as a solution simply gives rise to a series of other problems. Most students with the will to study, due to lack of proper lighting or frequent power cuts, have to succumb to studying under street lights or under the dim lighting of the kerosene lamps, post sunset. While, it is worth marveling at the determination of students who sweat out as they study in scanty lighting, it’s hard to neglect that it comes at several costs.', 'Kerosene lamps emit carbon monoxide that is harmful for the health and environment – according to the World Bank, breathing kerosene fumes is equivalent to smoking two packets of cigarettes a day! Besides, even the light emitted by them isn’t sufficient, does not spread evenly and can be damaging for eyesight. Cost wise, every household in India spends Rs 900 annually on kerosene, the amount being subsidized by the Government. Kerosene lamps are not only dangerous to operate, but have also been known to cause fire accidents and burn injuries to children due to kerosene spillovers and explosions on a regular basis in rural areas. The lamps are dirty, while the smoke emanating from these lamps can cause serious respiratory problems. Kerosene or other fuels used for lighting are even costly and sometimes difficult to procure.', 'Kerosene also has an environmental spillover, as the increased consumption of oil can cost dearly to our country in terms of non-availability in the near future. The lack of proper light often led to loss of interest in studies among the children. The result was that many students either dropped out or were irregular or under- performing in their studies.', 'Alternatives must be and are being explored under such circumstances, yielding successful results.', 'The Beginning of OCOL:\nThe issue of inadequate lighting and its side effects in the field of education caught the attention of Dr Ranganayakulu Bodavala (Dr Ranga), a Harvard alumnus. Prior to this, since 2002, Dr Ranga had been actively working in the field of Rural Development and assisting rural communities in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Maharashtra through introduction of people-friendly interventions. Dr Ranga, who holds a PhD in Health Information Systems, used advanced and innovative technologies in Home Lighting, ICT, Health, and Education through Volunteers for Rural Health, Education, and Information Technology (www.THRIVE.in), an NGO which he founded, to help the rural communities where he worked. Says Dr Ranga', 'I was deeply moved by the issues faced by the people due to lack of electricity and basic lighting for domestic needs and thereon focused on the development of solar, LED Lighting, and other viable renewable energy solutions to meet the challenges.', 'However, it wasn’t an easy job to meet these challenges. The resolve was there and so were the means, now came the time to put them into action which was all set to be another daunting task.', 'The need for a reliable partner for large scale supply of equipment coupled with the lack of proper manufacturing support, encouraged him to form Thrive Energy Technologies in 2007. Interestingly, Thrive Energy Technologies is now a leading manufacturer of solar LED lighting and Solar Photo-voltaic solutions aimed at helping rural communities with household and institutional needs. Explains Dr. Ranga:', 'One of the innovative solutions was to address the problem of students facing difficulty while studying in either the light of street lights, or under dim, polluting and dangerous oil based or kerosene lanterns, by providing them with highly efficient, solar chargeable, LED Study Lights which are much cleaner, brighter, and safer to use.', 'He was aware that plenty of investment, funding and social support would be required for his dream to take wings. He decided to launch a large-scale social initiative with the support of like-minded and highly-motivated individuals who would promote the concept and spread awareness. Thus OneChildOneLight (OCOL) was born in April 2009.', 'The organization, One Child One Light, is lighting up a new possibility in these adverse conditions and making the most while the sun shines, literally! It has come up with solar-chargeable LED lights that are much more luminous and long lasting and can spark off a healthy spirit of enthusiasm for studying in children! The mission of this endeavour was to support every underprivileged child’s right to education by giving a safe, clean and low-cost study light. The programme simultaneously aimed to eradicate the use of kerosene for lighting.', 'Since its inception in 2009, it took nearly a year for OCOL to gain momentum. One of the early implementations of OCOL was on 28th March 2010, where 50 children from Pillapalem Village School in Tirupati were provided Study Lights by Thrive Energy Technologies. The students who were preparing for their annual examinations used the re-chargeable, eco-friendly LED study lights when the power went out at 8:30pm on the occasion of Earth Hour to address climate change. That same year in April, children from Gowlidoddi Residential School, located on the outskirts of Hyderabad, were provided LED Study Lights. The children were quite elated on receiving the lamps and put them to use immediately.', 'On asking him about the impact of the OCOL program, Dr. Ranga said:', 'Due to the intervention of the OCOL programme, most of the students who received the lamps were quite relieved and excited to have their own lights which they could care for and charge them on their own, free of cost, using the solar panels. In many children it has caused renewed interest in studies as they are able to study even at night and catch up on lost time. They are now attending school regularly.', 'Why LED?\nLED was the leading hero that emerged throughout the OCOL initiative. LED is a type of semiconductor diode which is known for its efficiency and durability. There were several reasons why LED was chosen for this mission. For a watt of electricity consumed, an LED could produce more luminosity (Lumens) brightness than any known CFL (which was the nearest competitor) or Tube-light. The LED batteries did not drain out quickly unlike when used with CFLs or other lights and as a result the battery charged well and lasted longer, giving about 1 Lakh light hours as compared to CFLs which gave only about maximum 20,000 light hours. Also, as opposed to a measly 3 lumens luminosity yielded by kerosene lamps, the OCOL light emits an impressive 150 lumens luminosity. It also comes with a guarantee of 3 years.', 'Apart from these economical and output factors, LED lights also withstood the health test. Further, unlike CFLs, LEDs did not contain mercury and other gases which were known to be polluting and dangerous. LEDs are a lot cooler than their counterparts, offering a pleasant and clean light. The LEDs were much smaller in size and provided greater scope for innovation in design. They are also safe to use, as the lights are enveloped in plastic casing that are sturdy and heat resistant.', 'It’s also interesting to know, that there is not one, but several ways of charging the OCOL light! The OCOL lights can be easily charged at home with the help of a Nokia charger. With 3 hours of charging, it can be used at a stretch of 10 hours. In case of a power cut, Thrive Energy’s solar panel (manufactured in Germany) can be used for charging the study light. Alternatively, the lights can be charged in the day time, by the bulk charging systems, set up in the schools by Thrive Energy Technology.', 'With all the positives in favour of the LED lightings, the OCOL team is constantly striving to further improve upon certain existing shortcomings as well. These include steps taken by them to make the lights even more affordable, reduction in failure rate, improving charging systems, comfortable sighting and increase in safety.', 'Supporters and partners:\nOCOL has been supported in its ventures by several individuals as well as corporate houses, who have sponsored LED Study lights for the children through philanthropic or CSR initiatives. In fact, International Paper, a globally renowned corporate house even launched an initiative to provide LED study lights to the children of the Zila Parishad high schools in 6 districts of Andhra Pradesh. Other NGOs serving as donors of the LED lights include regional Grameen Banks in Uttar Pradesh, ARTIC NGO, Leprosy Mission Trust in Andhra Pradesh, Chanura Micro Finance Institution in Manipur, Manikgarh Cement in Maharastra and Rotary Club of Mumbai North end. Overseas organizations such as ZARA Solar Ltd., Mwanza, Tanzania and Williamson Tea’s Tinderet Tea Estate, Kenya are some of the several sponsors from across the shores.', 'And that’s not it! Many corporate bodies, such as Sonata Software and Dr Reddy’s Labs in Hyderabad do it as a team by encouraging their employees to contribute towards the OCOL initiative and collectively provide LED study lights to the underprivileged children from schools. OCOL has been fortunate to receive noteworthy contributions from these sources.', 'OCOL has also partnered with NGOs, particularly those that work towards the upliftment of children and education. One such NGO that the OCOL has recently partnered with is Education Park, an organization which aims to provide education and facilities in rural areas of Madhya Pradesh which are at par with city level schools. Education Park is headed by Prof. Chetan Singh Solanki, from IIT Mumbai, who aims to provide OCOL LED Study Lights to at least 1 Lakh children from Bhikagaon in MP at highly subsidized rates.', 'OCOL has joined hands with IIT Mumbai to bring into effect an ambitious project where nearly 1 million children would benefit from the programme. It would involve setting up of Assembly centers and technology transfer and training to rural entrepreneurs for better and faster dissemination.', 'It’s not only all about the business ventures and ambitious projects that OCOL has chalked out. Emotions have played a vital role investment too. To be able to contribute LED lights, you need not have to be a rich entrepreneur or belong to a large corporate house. A heart and will is all you need to be a sponsor. OCOL has approached students from schools in urban areas to celebrate their birthdays and festive occasions, by contributing solar LED study lamps through OCOL to help their rural counterparts. Said Dr Ranga:', 'Some of the most touching experiences came in the form of contributions towards the programme, not from the major companies or high net worth individuals, but from students of some of the smallest schools catering to underprivileged children who collected notable amounts of money for the benefit of children who are even more underprivileged than them.', 'Some of the contributing schools include Shivappa School in Hyderabad and St Gabriel’s School, St Ann’s School and Satya Sai Vihar in Secunderabad. The amount raised from these schools was distributed to the social welfare hostels in Secunderabad and in Govt school in Anumalaveedu, Ongole district.', 'Challenges Faced: \nThe conquest made is a brave one but it isn’t bereft of troubles. Prime among them is the lack of awareness about the LED lights and the OCOL initiative. In their efforts to spread awareness, sometimes there is no response during summer vacations when the schools are shut. Lack of understanding on the ill-effects of kerosene and environmental hazards posed also present a serious obstacle to the OCOL initiative.', 'While OCOL followed up on schools, they realized much to their shock that some children were unknowingly being made to part with their lights by being offered money or some other form of exchange. To combat this problem, a strategy was implemented. Recalls Dr Ranga:', 'We made a conscious decision to henceforth provide the study lights under heavily subsidized rates with the help of donors, rather than give them out for free. This creates a sense of ownership of the lights and the children take good care of them and the solar panel chargers. There have been no issues with such an approach.', 'Currently the Cost of the LED Study Light is Rs.499/-. When subsidy is applied, the beneficiaries shell out Rs.200/- and the donors will chip in Rs.200/- and Rs.100/- discount is provided by the manufacturer – Thrive Solar Energy Private Limited (Formerly Thrive Energy Technologies Pvt. Ltd.).', 'Impact:\nThe OCOL initiative has a current reach of a whopping 4,30,000 children and targets to reach out to 12 crore children. Initially, the programme was partially funded by Thrive Energy Technologies and partly from Dr. Ranganayakulu’s own pockets. Now, the programme has been able to reach out to several organizations, institutions, NGOs, and Individuals who sponsor the study lights for the children. Many microfinance companies are now coming forward to participate.\nApart from children from the economically weaker sections of the society, children from rescue homes and orphanages have also been provided the Study Lights. Many individuals have purchased lights for gifting.', 'Some of the beneficiaries of the OCOL lights include underprivileged school children in Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka, Kerala, Gujarat and Odisha and also overseas in Kenya and Tanzania, as well as to women self-help groups and their children in Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur and even to the miners in oil exploration areas of Northern part of Kenya and Eithopia.', 'Future Plans:\nThe OCOL aims to increase the number of lights available as well as spread greater awareness regarding this initiative through increased number of school and college visits, partnerships, supporting CSR initiatives of corporate houses, social networking through its website, Facebook page and forming a steady and reliable team of promoters.', 'The OCOL lights are thus doing their bit towards realizing the dream of an educated future generation – by fostering concentration while studying, reducing global warming, improving health standards and enabling some of the poorest strata of society to afford lighting.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

She reports from the scene of the devastating floods on the current situation in the affected areas, on the aid provided by the administration, and the stupendous work being carried out by trekkers, mountaineers, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), army personnel and NGOs.', 'As you leave the main market of uttarkashi it is evidently silent. You can hardly find people – it seems more like a ghost town – which is so different from what I have experienced in the past when I was here to do my basic mountaineering course in 2009. The recent floods in Uttarakhand have left most people stunned and angry. Beyond the pilgrimage spots, the tragedy has a lot of ramifications for locals, the most important being loss of livelihood.', 'A couple of my mountaineering friends from Uttarakhnd and I have embarked on providing relief operations to remote villages of Uttarkashi where as yet no kind of relief has reached. We accompanied the staff from Sri Bhuvaneshwari Mahila Ashram (SBMA) and Tata Relief Trust to assess the situation in some remote villages in the upper reaches of Maneri. These villages have lost their homes and livelihood – their agricultural land.', 'A Rapid assessment by SBMA shows that Uttarkashi has 120 villages which have been completely affected. There are no roads for their connectivity to mainland, no electricity and above all, no ration to even cook food. This is the third monsoon disaster since 2010 in this region. After the first two disasters, the government had identified 250 villages in this region as being in the danger zone but still did not take any action in terms of relocating them or anything else.', 'Currently, Bachendri Pal, an Everester who hails from Uttarakhand and is the head of Tata Adeventure Foundation, is overlooking the relief operations undertaken by Tata Relief Trust. The trust has tied up with SBMA and adopted six villages – New Didsari, Didsari, Pilang, Jadaou, Bayana and Shyaba. In all there are are a total of approximately 400 families who will be provided relief.', 'We trekked up to New Didsari along with Pal, Prem Latha Agarwal, two other mountaineers Yash and Guneet (who were just back from their Mt Thelu expedition two days ago after walking for about 60 kms in 2 and a half days rescuing tourists and pilgrims on their way – carrying their bags apart from their own 30 kg or more backpacks; and the staff of SBMA and Tata Relief Trust.', 'New Didsari is in a pathetic situation. There are in all 55 families in this village, and of these, 20 have lost their homes. And many others have lost their cultivated land. Didsari is very remote. The access bridge on Bhagirathi river to their village has broken down. In the absence of help from the administration, the villagers themselves have rebuilt an access path to their village. The other villages like Bhayana, Shyaba, Pilang and Jadao are even farther. The only way to get to these villagers is by trekking treacherous mountainous routes. Pilang is still facing problems with the mountain landslides. Currently access to this village has become extremely difficult.', 'In all there are about 400 families across these six villages who are in a helpless situation having lost everything and with no relief in sight. They have managed to get a few packets of biscuits in the name of food. Children here are not used to eating biscuits but, in the absence of solid food, have been feasting on them, and most kids in New Didsari that we visited had stomach issues such as pain, diarrhea and fever. No medical aid has reached these villages yet.', 'The villagers are sad, disappointed and angry. “We have lost everything,” says Rajeshree Surendra, from New Didsari whose husband is in ITBP, posted in Leh. Tata Relief along with SBMA will be providing tents, rations such as rice, dal, tea, salt, sugar, candles, matches, oil, blankets and medicines. Villagers are asking for very basic materials.', 'The worst dilemma for the villages and for NGOs working on relief operations is how does the relief material reach these villages. The only way it can be done is by air dropping. Permission is being sought from the administration to allot helicopters immediately to air drop relief materials in these villages. Villagers who I spoke to have lost hope in the government and administration and are not even expecting anything from them. Their hopes are hinging on people like Bachendri Pal and NGOs. They feel that at least they will get some relief from them.', 'Overall scenario in Uttarkashi is devastating, and how! Thousands of buildings and homes, bridges and roads have been destroyed in the tragedy. The roads have caved in every 25 mts, and in the parts of roads that remain, one can see visible cracks.', 'Another aspect of the human tragedy is that the floods have destroyed not just the farmlands but also the irrigation system in the mountains, including the network of canals and irrigation channels. This has compounded the loss for the villagers. Potato, which is their mainstay agricultural cash crop, is supposed to be harvested over the next one month and villagers have lost this source of income as well.', 'The incessant rains that hit the state over three days from June 14, leading to flash floods and cloudbursts, have led to hundreds of deaths and hundreds others are missing. Armed forces , Air Force and ITBP are still on duty trying to locate people and rescue the ones stranded. In the last two days, with the weather blessing Uttarakhand with clear skies, rescue operations have been good. Sorties have been flying to and fro non-stop.', 'A brief chat with the Uttarkashi DM revealed that the administration has divided Uttarkashi into 11 sectors – each having about 15 villages. 40 people have been deployed for each of these sectors, and they will be accompanied by ITBP personnel in choppers to be dropped at certain points, from they will trek up to reach out to the villagers and give them relief materials such as dry ration, candles, diesel, oil etc. Total loss of Uttarkashi district alone due to the floods has been estimated at Rs 3000 crore.', 'Uttarakhand being an adventure and mountaineering paradise, it is the adventure and mountaineering community along with NGOs that are trying and getting to these villages on foot and providing relief materials to the villagers. It is the dedicated and selfless effort of this community that is holding up hope for the villagers despite their dire circumstances.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
