Currently, less than 50% of our children in the age group of 6-14 years attend school. The Right to Education (RTE) bill 2010 provides a necessary foundation for spreading primary education in the country, which should improve the percentage of children attending school. In absolute numbers, this bill could impact 35 million children who are right now deprived of education due to various reasons.', 'Aseema, a Mumbai based non-profit organization, is working with underprivileged children to provide them a nurturing and stimulating educational environment. By doing so, it aims to bring these children back into the mainstream of society.', 'Assema Montessori is a first of its\xa0kind center for street children in India. Established in August 2000 at Pali Chimbai Municipal School, the Montessori provides children with a firm education foundation.', 'In 1996 Assema started the Project Igatpuri for educating the tribal children of Awalkheda, a small hilly village situated 5 kilometers from Igatpuri.', 'The Better India caught up with Aseema and here is an interview with them:', 'In 1988, Dilbur Parakh worked with the Union of Civil Liberties in Thailand and was earlier involved with social work in Mumbai. Since 1990, she worked as the legal officer for Asia with the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) in Geneva. But she always knew that she had to work with children. The introduction of the Convention on the Rights of the Child during Dilbur’s posting in Geneva strengthened her resolve to work for the rights of children. She worked there for over five years and then decided to quit her job and get back to India. On returning to India, she started ‘Aseema’ at the grassroot level with some like-minded people. Aseema was formally started on 15 December 1997.', 'What is Project Igatpuri? And the challenges you faced while setting up this project?\nA systematic study of the people at Awalkheda, Igatpuri and the surrounding villages, has helped Aseema achieve a comprehensive understanding of the educational needs of the children in these villages. The experience gained in conducting educational activities in Mumbai has helped in starting our Education Centre for Tribal Children in Awalkheda. The Education Centre will empower the children with a strong educational foundation and enable them to build a brighter future for themselves and their community.', 'Construction of the Pre-Primary Section started in February 2009. Owing to the torrential rainfall in Igatpuri from June to September, we have been able to carry out construction activities only from October to May. A classroom and a toilet block at the Education Centre have been constructed. A Solar Energy system has also been installed. This is necessary in Igatpuri as the area faces power cuts ranging from 3 hours to 9 hours a day. We had the Public Works Department construct a paved road up to the village. Tree plantation drives have been carried out with the help of the local people as well as children from our Mumbai projects and a well has been dug which is open to use by the villagers as well. Aseema’s well was the only source of water for some people last year. A water harvesting expert has contoured the land and contour trenches and check dams have been created which will help to recharge the well.', 'In March 2010, Aseema started pre-primary classes for the first batch of 30 children.\n\nThis year we also had 40 children studying in the Sitabai Kavji Mengal Aanganwadi set up by Aseema in the nearby village of Jambhwadi, Igatpuri in July 2007. These schools are the only well-functioning schools in the area and have become centers for further development of the community.', 'We have recruited local people as teachers and have introduced them to Aseema’s teaching approach. The Aseema approach stems from the belief that all children have an innate love for learning which grows and flourishes when there is a bonding between the teacher and the child. It also lays a lot of emphasis on the holistic development of the child rather than only academic achievement. This approach draws from the Montessori approach to education which gives children the freedom to learn and grow at their own pace. The school has, therefore, been equipped with carefully designed Montessori material and other attractive teaching aids.', 'The challenges we faced and are still facing are numerous. It will take a while before the local community completely accepts and trusts us. It is only once they see their children learning and doing well at school that they will really believe that education can change their lives. Other challenges like raising funds for the construction and running of the Education Center continue but when we see the little ones regularly coming to school and enjoying their work, we feel it is all worthwhile.', 'What is the social impact Aseema has been able to make on the community?', 'Aseema’s Community Center acts as an integral link between the communities the children come from and the schools. It generates awareness about the importance of education, monitors attendance and dropout rates, etc. Through our activities in the school, children are becoming more aware of their rights and responsibilities and subsequently they carry this awareness forward into the community. The parents are thrilled and proud to see their children perform at the Annual Exhibition, Annual Sports Day and Annual Day as well as on Open Days and at PTA meetings.\n\nIn June 2009, we introduced a teacher training programme for community women at our Pre-Primary Center located at the Santacruz (W) Municipal School. This in-house integrated training programme draws young women from the local community and gives them intensive training in the Aseema approach to education. This programme has strengthened the student-teacher bond. With both the children and the trainee teachers coming from similar socio-economic backgrounds, they relate better to each other, and the trainee teachers are committed to ensuring that the children grasp all that is being explained in class. It gives them an opportunity to adopt a professional career, contribute meaningfully and gain the respect of the community.', 'What are the other activities carried out by Aseema to provide holistic education to children?', 'Since its inception, Aseema has been striving to provide high quality, relevant education to Mumbai’s most neglected children – children living on the streets, or in slums, in inhuman conditions. Today, we are proud to see over 1000 children enrolled in school, learning well and exploring their potential.', 'In partnership with the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), we are running three schools – Pali-Chimbai Municipal School (PCMS)in Bandra west , a suburb of Mumbai, the Santacruz (W) Secondary Municipal School (SMS) and the Kherwadi Municipal School (KMS)in Bandra East. Our programmes in PCMS and SMS may be regarded as models for education in Mumbai. They have shown how MCGM schools can upgrade their educational programmes and offer better services to children while working in partnership with NGOs and other bodies. We are currently implementing this model at KMS which we have recently adopted and are keen that it be replicated in other municipal schools as well. We are currently working with the MCGM through high level committees and other focus groups to promote the implementation of a well designed public private partnership.', 'How did the concept of Children’s Art came about? What are the products on offer and how do you plan to take it forward?', 'A somewhat unique programme at Aseema is the transforming of some of the artistic flair of the children into marketable products. Our children create beautiful art under the guidance of teachers who give them complete creative freedom. The children’s drawings are then used to make high quality products of paper, ceramic, cloth and wood.', 'We started with selling the children’s paintings at exhibitions and gradually moved to transferring their paintings on to products like crockery, napkins, scarves, paper bags, etc. The popularity of our products drew the attention of the students of the Wharton Business School, who with the help of students of S.P. Jain Institute of Management studied our products and created a business plan to help Aseema become self sustaining. This study led to the establishment of our Products Division.', 'Our products include greeting cards, ruled books, notepads, art books, gift paper pen holders, combined holders, card holder, memo holder, pin holder, trivets, mugs, key chains, bags, mobile and spectacle cases, pencil pouches, change pouches bed table, coffee table, coasters, trays, etc. Prices range from Rs. 15 to 2000 and all proceeds are ploughed back into Aseema’s educational projects.', 'Click here to visit the website and to know more about Aseema.\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Writer, Researcher interested in social enterprise, innovation, culture and networks.

That is a famous quote by Francis Bacon.\n\nMost of us who love reading cherish the time we spent as children in libraries scanning through books of various shapes and sizes with vivid covers and enticing titles. Libraries are the repositories of knowledge. But a large number of children are deprived of this wonderful experience; they don’t get to read which in effect does not inculcate in them the habit of studying.', 'AWIC, Association of Writers and Illustrators for Children, is a voluntary organisation working towards the promotion and development of literature for children in India. It represents writers, illustrators, librarians, editors and publishers. Founded by late K.Shankar Pillai in 1981, AWIC endorses the ethics and functions of the global organisation IBBY (International Board on Books for Young People), a non-profit which represents an international network of people from all over the world who are committed to bringing books and children together.', 'The various projects of AWIC include the following:', 'Winner of the IBBY-ASAHI Reading Promotion Award, this project was started in 1983. Today 114 libraries in Delhi and across India have been setup under this voluntary scheme to promote reading. Each library is provided with free books. The project aims at making good books available to children who have no access to books .', 'Most of the libraries are managed by AWIC members on a voluntary basis. While most libraries function from the homes of AWIC members, some libraries have also been set up in parks, hospitals, railway platforms and slum areas for underprivileged children. Each year AWIC gives out one Best Librarian award and two Reader of the Year awards!', 'AWIC initiated IBBY library project – creating children’s libraries at Madi Village in Delhi (NCR), at Tezu in Arunachal Pradesh, at Jaipur, Rajasthan and Daman in Goa.', 'In 1995 AWIC launched its Literacy Project and has published two Hindi alphabet books under its schemes, ‘Buy, Teach and Gift’ and ‘Teach and Gift’. Under the second scheme, AWIC distributes these books free in all Indian states, including remote areas where children have no access to good books.', 'Book Promotion Cell promotes the cause of children’s books written by Indian authors by conducting book talks. Besides this, the organization participates in national and international children’s books fairs.', 'The Book Therapy Project is a particularly interesting one and was started after the 26/11 terrorist violence in Mumbai. It was started in order to promote the use of books to help children during those difficult times. Reading can be therapeutic; helping children come to grips with situations that create turmoil in their minds. Book Therapy helps children cope with such stressful situations, and even prepares them for further eventualities. Through workshops AWIC aims to train facilitators to administer book therapy and also develop books, including picture books and anthologies, which provide a healing effect to children.', 'If you have some free space in your home or office, you too can start a library for the underprivileged!

2,2010-7,"['Archives', 'Innovation: Biomass Cooking Stoves']","['In this article, we write about the Biomass Cooking Stove innovation that is being nurtured by the Villgro foundation.', 'Micro and small establishments that provide boarding services to 40 – 100 individuals in rural and semi-rural areas face the three pronged problem of not having the access, both financially and in terms of availability , to LPG, having to incur the costs of large amounts of biomass required to run their relatively inefficient stoves and dealing with the associated health impacts that inefficient, outdated stoves generate.\nUnlike small households, micro and small establishments rely on purchasing fire wood and not on collecting biomass. These costs average around 2000 Rs. / ton. As such the inefficiency of stoves used by this category of users has a direct impact on their expenditure and thus on their income and savings. When compared to households these establishments utilize their stoves for much longer (upto 10 hours a day when catering to 100 customers) and thus the impacts on wood consumption and health issues are\nexasperated.', 'Burning wood creates CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Establishments, based on size, generate between 20 – 80 tons of co2 a year. While small when considered at a national or global scale, this contributes to climate change in its own way.', 'The Biomass Cooking stove is an application specific high efficiency wood burning stove specifically designed for a range of cooking needs. The innovation offers to the end user: saving in fuel costs, by being up to 50% more efficient than conventional stoves and improved health impacts.  The features that make the stoves innovative are, optimum air fuel ratios controlled by efficient vents, well designed combustion chamber volume resulting in high combustion and heat transfer efficiencies, good insulation to prevent losses to the walls and an optimally designed chimney to vent the flue gases away from the breathing zone of the cooks and designed to reduce heat losses to the atmosphere.', 'Owners of micro and small boarding establishments, including semi-portable food vendors will be impacted. This covers a range of individuals with daily revenues between 500 to 5000 rupees per day. A market survey revealed that the total number of tea shops, small & medium hotels and street food vendors to be 73,650 in the state of Tamil Nadu alone.\nOn the lower end of the economics scale – this includes street side food vendors who spend considerable amounts of their income on firewood. These individuals were shown to spend upto 30,000 Rs. annually on firewood with monthly take home incomes of around 7000 Rs. On the higher end of the economics scale – this includes proprietors of small size ‘hotels’ catering to the needs of approximately a 100 customers a day.', '\nSustainTech India Pvt. Ltd. (SIPL) is reaching out to the needs of a fuel stressed segment of society – initially the street food vendors, who operate on push carts and where cooking is done inside the cart or on railway platforms, roadside shops and small hotels who with a roof and some seating capacity.\nA survey conducted shows that these stoves are in operation for about 10 hours every day and each unit caters to about 100 clients every day. The 65,000 fuel efficient wood burning stoves (considering only the tava, frying stoves and tea kettles) that would be sold by SIPL in the first five years would therefore offer a safer, cooler and healthier working environment to at least 65,000 cooks and 6.5 million people who would eat\naround these stoves every day. India has a high incidence of respiratory ailments and a smoke free working environment would reduce the medical expenses of the affected people working around wood fires.\nThe survey data also shows that 38% of the street food vendors and tea shops use kerosene for their cooking needs. Very limited kerosene is available in fair price shops and this is inadequate. Very often the sector uses unfair means to procure kerosene creating stress and tension besides eroding the profitability.\nA Frying Stove Biomass based\nMoving to a biomass stove would reduce the stress associated with procurement of kerosene, improve profitability of the business and show that it is possible to replace a fossil fuel with a renewable energy source.\nAt the global level the movement to a fuel efficient wood stove would significantly abate CO2 emission. A survey conducted in the project area shows that stoves are in use for about 8 -14 hrs every day and for 300 -350 days in a year. Data has also been collected about fuel consumption patterns in conventional stoves and performance of improved stoves tested and some of them certified. With a projected stove life of 5 years, the carbon abatement potential of the venture through installations in the first 5 year planning period would be 3.7 million tons of CO2. (1 kg of firewood saved = 1.5 kg of CO2).\nFirewood is purchased by the end users of SIPL products at Rs 2000 / ton. The saving in fuel costs, because of energy efficiency should enable the end user to payback the cost of the stove without financial stress in 12- 18 months. Each stove purchased would on an average save Rs 20,000 – 30,000 of fuel cost every year.

Many commence their profession at the young age of five to eight years. Most of them have never attended any school. While collecting rags they are subjected to chemical poisons and infections.
