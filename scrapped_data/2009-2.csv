The school is Deena Seva Sangha, located close to the old Kino theater.', 'We first entered a small room termed as ‘hostel’. It was a dark room, perhaps 20 feet by 7 feet wide. Aluminium chests were stacked wall high in one corner. Various pants and shirts hung on top of one makeshift wooden wall which served as a provider of privacy.', 'Going ahead, we were taken to the main hall that served as the dining and sleeping area for the 65 students who study and live here. Then we were shown the store room, where the food rations are kept. The school sends its students to the city market once a week to get vegetables, which are given free to them by some generous and charitable vendors.\nMoving on to the school building, which lay adjacent to this ‘hostel’, we were shown a pipe jutting out of the wall, gaping with its outlet wide open. In the past, the volunteers have put a tap on it to facilitate drinking of water, but every time they have done that, someone has stolen the tap overnight. A measly 10 rupees for us, but perhaps a meal for someone else. I then entered the building, which is two storeyed. Walking through the corridors, I see the empty classrooms with wooden benches strewn around. I reach the last classroom and look at the blackboard. Someone has scribbled the famous four letter ‘f’ word on the board, in cursive handwriting.', 'I move back towards the entrance and by now one of the volunteers has managed to get the door to the library opened. I enter the library and find that it is being used more as a junk yard, with all sorts of things lying around. There are broken tubelights jutting out of brown dusty cardboard boxes, a broken abacus lying in the middle of the room. In one corner, is a small two door cupboard that has the much sought-after books (much sought after by the visitors, since this was a libary after all). The books are few and most are torn. I then get out of the building and look at a smaller building in front of me. This one has the words ‘War on Want, UK’ engraved on top of it. “Why would someone provide war when you want it”, I wondered to myself. It took me a few more moments before realizing that the word “want” was used as a noun, not as a verb. Which meant that the word “want” here referred to the property of being in need of something. A little google-ing later gave me the website of this organization – War on Want.\nWe then get out of the building and there is a tea session held by the volunteers. Their aim? To showcase the state of the school and garner some funds.', 'If you would like to visit the school or donate, contact these folks: Yuva Bengaluru', '(This post originally appeared on Dhimant’s personal blog with the title War on Want: www.dhimantparekh.com)\nImage Courtesy: http://yuvabengaluru.org\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Their main aims include:', 'With these objectives in mind, SIF has launched a number of projects in each of its area of focus. These include:', 'With their main intention of spreading greater awareness among people about diseases and their cures, SIF undertakes several informative programs in a year. One of these was “Unite for Diabetes”, a Diabetes awareness walk organized in Hyderabad in November 2008. Another ongoing project of theirs is the “ESI Project” in which they sensitize the beneficiaries on available corporate health services of ESI and to increase efficiency of the ESI program by setting up Helpdesks, Helplines, Blood Donation Camps and Medical Camps.', 'By developing pollution-free and healthy colonies in select areas, SIF aims to create “model colonies” that can be replicated in other parts of the nation and help sensitize the population about environmental ills. This is achieved by engaging the local populace in tree planting activities, assessing the pollution levels and educating the residents on pollution hazards and healthy practices of sanitation, etc.', 'With the help of NCC cadets, Bharat Scouts and Guides, NSS, Institutions, Schools and Government support, SIF has initiated the “Safer Society” Project for implementing road safety, school safety and environmental safety in a model zone. With this initiative, they have undertaken several awareness drives to promote greater safety standards among the general public.', 'In collaboration with the Government of AP on the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan program, SIF has undertaken the construction of two model schools in Tirumalagiri. Serving as an example of Public-Private Partnership with the government contributing 80% financially and SIF the other 20%, these 2 schools (one for girls and the other for boys) will actively seek people’s participation in providing all facilities appropriate for the overall development of each student in Academics, Sports and Community Services.', 'The organization has also started a “Security Guards Training and Employment Program” to promote employment and capacity building of unemployed youth and find them jobs in the security sector.', 'To know further about Synergy India Foundation, their work and ways in which you could volunteer/contribute, visit their website http://www.synergyindiafoundation.org/ or contact them at the following address:', 'Plot No. 30, Kalyan Nagar, Near Central Bank of India', 'e-mail: info@synergyindiafoundation.org\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

However, Professor AV Ramani has done just this.', 'damage to their heart valves. The device – an indigenous heart valve, which costs a fraction of the imported ones in use at the time, has been created after years of research and hard work.', 'Developed at the Chitra Thirunal Institute (CTI) under the patronage of Dr.Valiathan and Prof. S. Ramaseshan, the heart valve adheres to all international standards and has a titanium-based metal cage that is long-lasting and wear-resistant. The engineering demands of such a valve were very high. Deepa Mohan tells us more about\xa0the requirements of such a machine in this article for Citizen Matters, a Bangalore based news magazine:', '“It is worth remembering,” points out Prof. Ramani, “that the life of the heart valve IS the life of the patient”. The human heart beats about 80,000 times a day. For even a ten year life-span, the valve would have to function for at least 400 million cycles, which means a very high-precision engineering requirement, and, because the heart valve, typically, would be surgically implanted in younger people, it needs to be something that would last for a ‘normal’ lifetime.', 'Important decisions like allowing contributing partners to retain their intellectual property rights under a concept of joint ownership, and designing the valve specifically for Asian anatomy, where the valve dimensions are different from those of the western population, were other factors contributing to the success and prominence of the venture. Once developed, the challenge of marketing and large-scale manufacture of the product was undertaken by the TTK group, which set up a unit for this in Bangalore.', 'The indigenous heart valve is, in the words of Deepa Mohan:', '..a living proof of how academicians, government officials and business people can work together with great synergy to bring out a product that is both profitable and beneficial.', 'Read the complete interesting article here.\nImage Courtesy: Deepa Mohan in Citizen Matters', 'Link Courtesy: Uday Arya.

Only bio-degradable and plastic bags of over 40 microns thickness are allowed. A hefty fine of up to Rs. 1,00,000 or up to five years imprisonment for the defaulters shows that this time the government means business.', 'Not only that, the move has been supplemented by the introduction of an alternative to the banned material – a new kind of plastic bag which is woven using old plastic. These bags will be sturdier than the ordinary ones, and solve to some extent the problem of plastic waste management.', 'In lieu of this, the government has given grants of over Rs. 2 lakhs to three NGOs to manufacture these bags, and another to manufacture cloth bags. This article in Expressindia also gives more details on the grant recipients and the way in which these bags will be produced on the ‘polylooms’.', 'Going forward the Delhi government and its active Department of Environment is also considering giving grants for the manufacture of jute bags and using plastic in the manufacture of roads, as has been undertaken in some other parts of the country, including Bangalore. The initiatives taken display a seriousness of purpose, as action is also accompanied by alternative options, so that there is an incentive and possibility for change.
