What was your motivation behind it?', 'They Came Together During The Uttarakhand Tragedy And Gave Medical Relief To Hundreds Of Victims']","['‘Tragedy should be utilized as a source of strength.\nNo matter what sort of difficulties, how painful the experience is, if we lose our hope, that’s our real disaster’\n– Dalai Lama', 'A testament to this aphorism is Care Vectors which came into being to extend succour to the Uttarakhand tragedy victims. As Pranveer, the co-founder of the organization intoned, “For me, it all started tragically with 7 members of my extended family being the victims of the Uttarakhand tragedy. I along with my family members and friends did whatever we could to find them. It was then, that I came in contact with Dr. Varun, who had taken upon himself to help out millions of people in need of instant help in these dire circumstances,. Talking to the locals and analysing the problem at hand, we decided to encounter this in an organized manner and CVFCT came into existence.”', 'With Dr. Varun right amidst the rapids metaphorically and literally, Pranveer along with volunteers in South Korea initiated a  “Mission Warmth” to collect warm clothes for the devastated victims .\nAt one of Care Vectors’ medical camps.\nHere is an excerpt from the interview with Dr. Varun, Secretary, Care Vectors.', 'In the advent of Uttarakhand floods, all roads leading to the villages on the Gangotri national highway were deluded. Seeing that, I formed a team of volunteers, arranged medicines, emergency kit and somehow reached the affected area traversing onerous trails.\nOur team provided assistance at a time when there was no help in sight for the victims. From that moment, we realized that we need to formulate a dedicated health relief and rehab organization  for combating exigencies like Uttaranchal floods.\nThis way, on July 2013, Care Vectors Foundation Charitable Trust (CVFCT) came into being.', 'We conceptualized and started the Uttarakhand Flood Relief program in 2013. We regularly organized health check up and relief camps in isolated flood devastated villages around and above Uttarkashi upto Gangotri. As recently as the 1st week of December , we had relief camps in Siror, Lonthru, Bayna and Netala. We also assisted the Government Hospital in Uttarkashi by connecting them with specialist paediatrician and gynaecologist.\nWomen, teen-age girls and elderly were the worst affected as they could not come down the hill just to receive palliative care. In those flood affected areas water borne infections were rampant, followed by foetal and gynaecology related ailments.\nDuring the monsoon season from July-September, we trekked through the mountains and at times some of the volunteers got injured as well.  Our volunteer team comprised of medical and non-medico volunteers.\nApart from providing preventive and palliative care, our team headed by Dr. Atul Kanikar (MD,DCH) organized several camps in school to disseminate information regarding hygiene and first aid.', 'Care Vectors germinated from the thought of transmitting care from an individual to another.\nAs an infant organization, with little or negligible resources we have tried to contribute to the best of our capabilities in improving the lives of people living in this far flung mountainous terrain.  We have successfully developed a dedicated bunch of volunteers who are proud to call themselves Care Vectors of Uttarkashi. These care vectors have basic preventive health care training to tackle emergencies like floods, earthquakes etc.', 'Mission Warmth initiative is an effort to provide warmer clothes to the affected villages so that they can bear the long, harsh winters. We are asking our urban friends to donate their warm clothes (which are in decent condition) . The first leg of the program is over and we received great response from India and Korea and as a result have accumulated approx. 800 kgs of clothes. The second leg of transporting the clothes to  Uttarakhand was completed in the last week of January.', 'People of the flood devastated regions now recognize ‘Care Vectors’ . We hope to develop a self-sustaining health care facility for the  resource deprived people of this region and to create a means of livelihood especially during the lean months when tourism is at the lowest ebb. We aim to spread our message to people across the world and have committed donors, volunteers join us in our endeavour.\nLast, but not the least – volunteers. It is because of people like Ms. Mamta D who takes care of funding, publicty and IT related queries of the non profit that organizations like ours are able to somehow trudge along.', 'For more information, about  how you can become a small vector in this polygon of care and empathy.

Enough reasons for all of us to be proud of initiatives like Sakhi Unique Rural Enterprise (SURE) – a rural distribution and marketing company working with rural women entrepreneurs (sakhis) and markets clean green products like improved cook stove, solar lantern, biogas, solar water heaters etc. The organization’s CEO Upmanyu Patil shares his views here.', 'It was in January 2009 that the idea of Sakhi Retail was incorporated by Swayam Shikshan Prayog (SSP). SSP is a Mumbai-based organization that strives to train and develop women in rural and grassroots areas so that they can be self-reliant and use their talent in some work. The organization also caters to the learning and development needs of the youth. The CEO of Sakhi Unique Retail Enterprise or Sakhi Retail (as it is called now) Upmanyu Patil shares with us about this amazing initiative.', '“Sakhi Unique Rural Enterprise was formed with an aim to improve the health and well-being of Indian rural households by distributing high-quality, affordable goods and appliances where they are least accessible. SURE aims to make rural women entrepreneurs with excellent door-to-door selling techniques so that they can earn commission-based income and enjoy significant commission-based income too. Promoting and marketing green products is one of the main focus of SURE.”', 'What started as a small organization of few hundred women now reaches over 500,000 families in five districts of India; Latur, Osmanabad, Beed and Nanded, in the Maharashtra region and Solapur in Western Maharashtra. Upmanyu Patil details,', '“It actually was the Oorja Stove, a smokeless biomass stove which used pellets (produced from a mush of corn cobs, coffee beans and sugar cane crush) as fuel, that led to the birth of Sakhi Retail. Since the target market for the Oorja stove was the millions of rural households using wood burning stoves, SSP thought of creating a rural distribution and marketing channel which would serve both the purposes – promote energy-efficient products in rural areas and train rural women to be entrepreneurs along with.”', 'So was the idea as effective in actuality as it is sounding here? Or were there any initial difficulties that posed problem in involving rural women?', '“Any idea/project related to women and that too in rural areas is never easy to implement! But because SURE aimed at empowering rural women by giving them livelihood opportunities by creating a supply chain of clean energy products; we were able to herald new dawns. SURE has always been very effective in rural context as it makes available eco-friendly and green products and services in non accessible areas. Till date, we have given livelihood opportunity to more than 800 women in rural Maharashtra and have reached across 1 lac households. We have been finalists in many awards and competition and also won the Sankalp–Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves Award for Innovation in Clean Cooking Solutions and received a cash grant of USD 15,000 along with the opportunity to be considered for the Alliance’s Spark Fund.”', 'Indeed, the award and recognition highlights the good work done by Sakhi Retail. This initiative has impacted on the society on three levels –', '“The success of SURE has been shaped by the parent organization SSP which has also been awarded USAID fund for scaling up similar approach in Maharashtra and Bihar to create 1000 women entrepreneurs in next 3 years. SSP has been working on non-profit model and has been getting funds from philanthropists, Governement and corporate sector. However, SURE works on revenue model and is working for profits. SURE generates monthly revenue of 20 lakhs INR on regular basis. The commission from manufacturers is in the 20-40% ratio which is split between the Sakhis (60 paise) and Sakhi Retail (40 paise).”', 'Upmanyu also talked about the future goals for SURE. He candidly expressed the ambition of expanding to five states by the end of 2020 having a network of around 10000 women entrepreneurs and reaching in at least two million rural households.', '“There is a great potential and opportunity in India to tap the rural markets and introduce energy-efficient products through women entrepreneurs. SURE has played an instrumental role in marketing innovative and socially-beneficial products such as Unilever’s Pureit and Godrej’s ChotuKool (innovative low-cost water purifier and refrigeration products targeted at BOP households), solar lanterns from D.Light, organic fertilizers, cattle feed supplement, and the Reuters Market Light SMS information service for farmers.”', 'It indeed is a wonderful way to make rural women independent financially as well as socially. We wish to see many more such organizations operating in other parts of India too!', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

In a slightly indulgent piece, Manish has put together a “coming of age” story where the hero and his fan take different routes in their journey of life but reach the same message. A message that continues to be reinforced by Leander’s evergreen performances on the tennis court. Read on to find out that Message', 'Leander was a hero for me, from a long time ago. Ever since I saw him hit a ball in anger in a Davis Cup doubles match versus Japan in 1990. India won that match (18-16 in the fifth set) and Leander grabbed my attention as his energy, exuberance, agility and desire was apparent even in the grainy coverage of DD sports.\nFrom that match onwards, Leander would rarely put a foot wrong when he played for India.', 'I was 15 years old and Leander was then a 16 year kid. It is an age where you believe miracles can happen.\nIt is an age where you believe that hard work, grit and a fighting spirit can beat talent on any given day.\nAn age where you want your country to win, come what may.', 'It was an age where Leander made all this and more come true for me by ensuring India beat top tennis playing nations like Switzerland, France, Croatia and Netherland at Davis Cup.\nIt is perhaps true that we shape our lives according to our hero’s. I would step into any game and like my hero, would fight tenaciously and scrap hard to make the most of my modest talents.', 'For Leander the singles player, things did not come easy. There was limited money even for an upcoming tennis star like Leander who was the World junior #1 and a junior Wimbledon champion. Indian tennis had yet to see sponsors come on board and Leander struggled to pay for a full time coach through his peak years.', 'Leander debuted on the pro tour in 1991 but the cold world of professional tennis with its cut-throat competition that promotes an individualist mindset did not quite seem to inspire Leander the patriot and team man. Exchange rate regulations meant that Leander would be handed 750 USD by his parents and told to play tournaments abroad till the money lasted. Much travelled Leander recently spoke poignantly about the time he had to convince a dressing room attendant to allow him to spend a night in the changing room of a tennis tournament.', 'There were solitary sparks of brilliance. However one tournament win and a victory over World #1 Pete Sampras in 1998 are meagre testimony to Leander’s skills on the professional singles circuit compared to his Davis Cup heroics.', '“I judged myself on how I performed in the Davis Cup. On that Friday-Saturday-Sunday there were no limits in my mind. If I believe strongly enough, it will be done. But I kept looking at the Davis Cup. Once a tie was over, I’d be looking three months down the road to the next tie. I just didn’t care enough about the tour. Davis Cup is the most important thing, and I love playing for my country.”', 'From 1991 till 1993 as a singles player, Leander progressed from World #275 to 178. However, in partnership with Ramesh Krishnan he had already helped India beat top tennis nations like Switzerland in 1992 and France in 1993.', 'In 1993 he led India to a memorable Davis Cup win on clay against France. Known as the “Miracle of Frejus”, Leander won both his singles matches against the top French players (Henri Leconte and Andre Boetsch) to help India win the tie.', 'While playing for India, Leander would get pumped up and teary eyed at the same time on just listening to his favorite song, “Saare Jahaan se Achaa”. Fans would follow him and even sing for him. I too joined the Leander Fan Club and started following their forum for tennis results. But it was the Davis Cup week that was the most special time of the year.', 'Every time Leander pulled on an India jersey, he seemed to climb an invisible ladder and pull off some of the most inspired tennis that I will ever watch. It was not just that he beat half a dozen players ranked in the World top 25. It was the fact that with every slinging stroke, every sparkling volley and with every breath, he was fighting for India, for me and for a glory that only optimistic and diehard fans could understand.', 'As Nirmal Shekhar wrote for the Hindu, “Seasons change. So do the opponents. The stage changes. So does the audience. The playing surface changes. So do the conditions.. But, in Indian sport – in Indian tennis to be precise – there is one thing that seems permanent, one enduring, eternal and glorious constant: Leander Paes’s heroism in Davis Cup “.', 'Leander also displayed his doubles prowess from an early age. He won a Gold medal for India in the Hiroshima Asian games in 1994 along with Gaurav Natekar. I was never one to wear my loyalties on my sleeve, but for years I enjoyed wearing a t-shirt which had Leander and Gaurav Natekar with tears in their eyes and the Asian games medal around their neck. I got that T shirt in Janpath and I wore it till it was in shreds.', 'By 1995, I saw Leander enact his heroic acts in person, at a Davis Cup tie on grass in Delhi against Croatia.\nLeander won his singles match on Day 1. On Day 2, Leander and Mahesh Bhupathi won a doubles match against the then world #7, Goran Ivanesevic and his partner, with some help from a wildly patriotic crowd. Goran likened the crowd to a zoo in the press, but we did not mind one bit and went home with the oddly sounding slogan still reverberating in our ears and hearts, “It Pa(e)s to be Leander”.', 'On Day 3, Leander upset Goran Ivanesevic (who would go on to win Wimbledon later) and it was a feat so remarkable that even I had given up on our chances for this 4th tie, with the plan to visit the stadium to cheer India in the fifth tie.\nI was told, Leander called the key cheerleaders over to his hotel for dinner that night and it is perhaps typical of the man.', 'Next: The Ultimate – Olympic Glory\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

It’s a key army area and about 220 kilometres away from Kargil. It connects with Tibet and China, and a lot of Chinese goods are smuggled over the border and sold in the markets. On the dreamy side of things, Leh has claimed the top slot in my list of the most beautiful places in India. It is breathtaking, with surprises around every road corner and mountain turn. It’s a chameleon, constantly changing, never the same twice. How it does that is a mystery to me.\nView of a streetlight against snowy mountains outside KBR Airport, Leh.', 'Apricots are a staple in Leh. In fact, the garden space of every household – big or small – sports at least one Apricot tree. The blooms are snow-white and cover the tree entirely during flowering season. Apple trees also sport white blooms, but they are bigger flowers and carry the promise of crunchy, juicy apples in their fragrance. (Next on my agenda – visiting Kashmir during apple-plucking season. I can’t wait to get my hands on the fruit-laden trees!)\nBlooms on an Apricot tree.', 'The architecture of Leh is much like the monasteries around the region – big windows, wood roofs, white walls, wood awnings and open spaces inside. Simple, pristine and at stark contrasts with the landscape.\nWindows typical to the region.', 'You’ll find several avatars of Buddha in the monasteries of Leh, and you’ll come to love the Buddhist way of life – simple, without expectations and focused on inner peace.\nPraying at Shanti Stupa.\nMaitreya – Buddha’s avatar – overlooking the village of Diskit.', 'Close your eyes and place your finger on any square of the Shade Card of the Universe, and you’ll find the colour in Leh. The display of vibrant hues and mellow shades is almost obscene in its onslaught on the senses – it’s just too much for our colour-starved-in-city-life selves to take. That said, it’s also the closest you’ll get to seeing Nature put out her best paintings.\nAt Sangam – the confluence of Zanskar and Indus Rivers.', 'That’s how long we were out for. I caught more sunrises and sunsets than I have on all my other holidays put together. The distances are fairly long and the pace mostly slow because of the terrain, so we woke up at around 4:30/5:00 a.m every morning and were out on the roads by 6:30/7:00.\nEvening at the hotel. Poplar and widow trees are the only form of vegetation around. They form the perfect foreground for a starry night, though.', 'Like all monasteries, Diskit rests on tops of a mountain. What’s the logic behind placing them there, i asked Dorje – our local guide. The answer was such a simple one that i wondered why i hadn’t thought of that – since monasteries and temples are dwellings of gods, they had to be at a greater level than the rest of the structures. Diskit Monastery has a unique statue of Maitreya  -Buddha’s avatar – holding the skull of a Mongolian King in his hand. Legend has it that this Mongolian King wanted to invade the surrounding areas, but by some twist of fate, ended up dead on the doorstep of the monastery every single day till an oracle suggested that his body be beheaded and the skull placed in the hands of the temple’s god. The king was never seen after that.\nDiskit Monastery, on the way back from Nubra Valley.', 'My first view of snow was at 6:15 a.m on Saturday morning, when we saw a blanket of white on the ground from our Jetlite flight.

Of the two, Patkar already enjoys a high profile, thanks to a lifetime devoted to activism. Sanyal, too, is a known face. During the 2009 General Election, this former CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland fought from the same constituency as an independent candidate, but failed to make an impact.  ', 'Sanyal and Patkar are two of the 57 women candidates that have been fielded by the newly founded AAP across the country. In fact, among all the political parties, AAP has the highest percentage of women in the fray. The list is a virtual rainbow of identities – there is Tiliya Devi, Nobel Peace Prize nominee and daily wage earner who has led a people’s movements against landlords; Dayamani Barla, land rights activist; Kamal Kant Batra, mother of Kargil hero Captain Batra; Soni Sori, once arrested for suspected Maoist activity, but later released by the Supreme Court; Anita Pratap, ex bureau chief of CNN; Kanchan Chowdhary, India’s first woman DGP, to name a few. While there is no common ideological string that binds them, these activists, journalists, professionals, teachers, homemakers, writers and actors seem to have made the cut for their commitment, recognisability and people connect. ', 'Meera Sanyal, 55, on the campaign trail in her constituency of South Mumbai. Sanyal, a Harvard alumnus, has had a distinguishedbanking career. (Credit: Pamela Philipose\\WFS)\nDr Sudha Mohan, professor of Urban Politics, Governance and Development at Mumbai University, explains this apparent randomness, “AAP is not a party that is rooted in any fixed ideology. It seems to believe that this is the time for action, not ideas. It presents itself as a party with a difference. The stated USP is that it offers a genuine alternative – whether in terms of candidates or a model for development.” ', 'This is what makes AAP a player to watch out for. In an atmosphere charged with an anti corruption sentiment, its lack of political history gives it a clean slate – and a clean image – to work with. This image is reinforced when a person of Patkar’s stature, acknowledged for her personal incorruptibility, came on board. Draped in handloom, with grey, carelessly plaited hair, she is an indomitable advocate of the socialist cause. Chucking a teaching job and leaving behind a half-completed PhD , she has spent 30 years criss-crossing the country, exposing  corruption, protesting against large dams and land grabs, agitating for the rights of the displaced and the marginalised.', 'Her journey is marked with prominent milestones: the Narmada Bachao Andolan, for which she is most widely recognised; she is founder of the National Alliance of Peoples’ Movement (NAPM), which functions as an advocacy and pressure group; she was Commissioner to the World Commission on dams; she led an agitation against the Tata Nano Plant at Singur; she has filed a PIL against the Lavasa project in Maharashtra; her agitations have stonewalled slum demolitions in Mumbai, and ensured proper rehabilitation… her CV is long, and the accolades are as numerous as the brickbats.\nDraped in handloom, with grey, carelessly plaited hair, MedhaPatkar is an indomitable advocate of the socialist cause. (Credit:Pamela Philipose\\WFS)\n“Patkar cannot be described as an outsider entering politics. She has always been a part of the system, she knows its workings and its flaws; she has had a tremendous impact on policy making. She has, in a way, demonstrated that one can exert influence even without being a part of the political system. Her desire to fight this election seems to stem from a thinking that she can do more,” says Dr Mohan. ', 'A similar conviction drives Patkar’s party colleague, Sanyal. “I joined the AAP because I am inspired by Arvind Kejriwal’s ideals, integrity and courage. India needs good leaders, who are competent and honest administrators. It is time for a new paradigm in politics,” says Sanyal. ', 'The daughter of a naval officer, Sanyal, a Harvard alumnus, has had a distinguished banking career. Articulate and at ease in corporate world, Sanyal holds a natural appeal for the upper class voters of South Mumbai. But she is not knocking on the doors of the rich for votes. Social media has been deployed as a powerful campaign tool by the AAP and Facebook and Twitter accounts of these two candidates are abuzz with information and pictures. Sanyal is campaigning spiritedly on the streets of Kamathipura, Chinchpokli and Mazgaon docks, the poor and middle-class neighbourhoods of her constituency.', 'Dressed in tasteful cotton sarees, with hair tucked neatly into the trademark AAP topi, she intersperses her meetings with a symbolic sweeping of the road with a broom, the party symbol. Sanyal listens to the people, exhorts them to vote for “truthfulness” and “clean politics”. One of the challenges she faces in her constituency is low voter turnout – only 42 per cent of the voters in South Mumbai turned up during the 2009 elections. “Until now, we believed there was little to choose from in the current political establishment. When I stood for elections in 2009, many friends in corporate India said they stayed away from politics because it was too ‘dirty’. The AAP offers a real alternative so I am confident that many who have not voted in the past will now do so,” she states. ', 'Sanyal, who has had considerable experience in policy formulation, was a part of the team drafting the party’s economic manifesto. Her personal vision for India, besides eradicating corruption and increasing transparency, includes empowering enterprise, fixing the education system, ensuring environment protection, formulating simpler regulation for business, less red tape and a simplified tax structure. She believes that some lifeline subsidies are essential, but with better targeting and fiscal prudence. For women, she is keen on social, economic and political empowerment; she is against reservations but supports affirmative action for certain categories. ', 'Patkar has a different wish list. Foremost on her mind are the housing woes of Mumbai. To check corruption, she advocates a Jan Lokpal bill in every state; she wants a revamp of labour policy to discourage contract labour and provide secure employment with full benefits to labourers and workers; strict enforcement of reservations under Right to Education and monitoring of private sector schools; handing over land and natural resource rights to adivasis and villagers, as also decision making powers regarding industrial development in their region. ', 'The two development trajectories envisioned by the women seem quite different. One imagines that, given the eclectic collection of people that represents the AAP, these divergences would be manifold at the national level. Yet, the AAP has managed to include both sets of priorities in the party manifesto. Sanyal says, “The AAP has created space for genuine dialogue.\xa0If we want ‘inclusive growth’ then we must take all opinions into account. The AAP has brought people like activist Medha Patkar and me to sit and talk to each other. Creating\xa0jobs and conserving the environment\xa0at the same time –\xa0that’s the policy for growth.” ', 'It would, perhaps, be premature to judge the relative merits and demerits of the path chosen by the AAP. But, Dr Mohan says, “AAP’s presence has enlivened the policy debate on critical matters.  Medha Patkar is, in my assessment, the strongest AAP candidate in Mumbai – even Maharashtra. Her entry into politics will bring hitherto neglected issues to the centrestage.” ', 'Sanyal agrees that irrespective of the election outcome, AAP has brought about a paradigm shift in Indian politics, “We have altered the perception of ‘winnability’ forcing the established parties to re-evaluate their own strategies. And we have also shown that the Indian voter is not apathetic.” ', 'In the light of the Delhi experience – where AAP could come to power against all odds – there is certainly no arguing with that!

He decided to support this girl in her education, a simple act of kindness. This helped her do well in life, have a family, raise children and settle abroad. Having seen the extent to which someone’s good deed impacted the life of his mother and his family, Shaun Jayachandran, took his step to give back.', 'Shaun is a basketball enthusiast and an educator in the US. Born and raised in Canada, settled in the US, he did not have much of a connection with India. But he had this strong calling to come to India and make a difference. For this, he blended his two passions, basketball and education, and founded Crossover Basketball and Scholars Academy.', 'Crossover is about crossing over the various man-made boundaries – of classrooms, of social and economic divides, and of backgrounds and cultures. Every year, Shaun and his team of volunteers bring a group of students, faculty and coaches from the US to Chennai for a two week long basketball camp. Here, at the American International School, the group converges with a local group of children. These children come from lower income and marginalized families and also from well-to-do families.', 'Crossover creates a platform where children learn to forget their differences, pick up leadership qualities, learn to make mistakes and be aggressive. These children, who come from backgrounds that are strikingly different, are successful at creating amazing synergies. Also, there are boys and girls on the court, striking a strong 50-50 ratio. They pay no fees to learn, the only thing they need to shell out is their enthusiasm.', 'There is one group of children in Chennai who are totally waiting for June to come, for Crossover to come – the children of Government Primary School, Rangarajapuram. Last year, Ramabhadran Sundaram, a Teach for India fellow at this school, came to know about Crossover and thought it might be a good idea to take his students to the camp. His students come from underprivileged backgrounds and the roughness of their background tended to influence their behaviour. He wanted to see what a sport can do to these children.', 'To Ramabhadran’s great surprise, the Crossover camp had a tremendous impact on these children. Conflicts that usually ended up in fights, now started seeing matured ‘conflict resolution’. The values of courage, loyalty and friendship that Ramabhadran couldn’t have preached in a classroom, started effortlessly seeping into the psyche of these children. All this happened in the midst of non-stop fun and the children are now eagerly waiting for the next session of Crossover scheduled for this June. This year, Crossover will hold camps that will host over 200 students from Teach for India.', 'Crossover’s aim is not to produce world class basketball players. Through Crossover, Shaun wants to showcase the value that sports can bring to education. The children get exposed to various skills that are needed to succeed in higher education, get better at academics and help in their future employment. Also, as these children learn to dribble, pass and shoot the ball, they also learn to become better human beings.', 'In the next fifteen years, Shaun dreams to build a free of cost residential school for children from low income and marginalized families.

What’s more, they have also drawn up a manifesto for their demands! Find out what they want and what the politicians think.', 'Bikash, 10, the son of daily wage labourers, lives in a slum in Bhubaneswar, the state capital of Odisha. On most days, this Class Five student of Ruchika School in the neighbourhood has to skip studies and work with his parents and two elder sisters on construction sites to supplement the family income. Although Bikash is not yet a voter, he wants political leaders hoping to come to power after General Election 2014 to promise they will tackle the issue of child labour.', 'Similarly, Jasmin, 12, a Class Eight student, wants her elected representative to provide safe drinking water near her Science Park ‘basti’ so that she doesn’t have to stand in line for hours at a tap a long distance away from her home and end up being late for her classes. The three tube wells in the slum she lives in have been dysfunctional for some years now and although there is piped water in homes here, erratic supply has the 500 residents making a beeline to a faraway source nearly every day. Apart from water, young Jasmin is demanding toilets in their homes so that she doesn’t have to step out at the crack of dawn for her daily ablutions.', 'Says Bikash, “Although I am not eligible to vote, I am a beneficiary of all development schemes and I should be given priority. Don’t I deserve amenities and a chance for a better life?” Adds Jasmin,', 'Safe drinking water is a basic facility that the government is supposed to provide to the people, so why has my slum been deprived of it? Leaders have to address these matters because it has adverse effects on our lives.', 'Like Bikash and Jasmin, across the city (Bhubaneshwar) there are around 100 child leaders who have put their thoughts together to create a Children’s Manifesto and Charter of Demands for political parties. They are no longer okay about their needs being overlooked and it is the Hamara Bachpan campaign that has enabled them to reflect on the larger social problems that affect them and look for workable solutions.', 'According to ‘Slums in India – A Statistical Compendium 2011’, published by the Government of India, every eighth urban child in the country in the age-group of 0-6 years stays in slums. Moreover, a report compiled by the National Buildings Organisation (NBO) of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, reveals that children living in slums constitute 13.1 per cent of the total child population in urban areas.', 'Urban poverty impacts these youngsters severely. As per a Planning Commission report, 50 per cent of urban child mortality in slums is the result of the lack of clean drinking water, while 23 million are at risk due to poor sanitation. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 22 per cent of children die because of respiratory diseases every year. And while there should be provision for “well ventilated houses for better indoor air quality and development of eco-friendly neighborhood”, in reality, the Census 2011 reveals, only 1 per cent notified and 7 per cent non notified slums in India have an electricity connection.', 'In this bleak scenario, the Hamara Bachpan campaign has emerged as an important initiative to create awareness and protect the rights of children living in slums. It is a national programme that works on ensuring a safe and healthy environment for impoverished city kids and calls for inclusion of child-friendly components in government schemes such as the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JnNURM) and Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY). At present, it is active in 15 states and has reached out to 15,000 children through its child clubs.', '“Despite being a signatory to the United Nation’s Convention on Child Rights, India has not been very successful in safeguarding their rights. Whether it is about education, nutrition and health or safety, children here have not been given a fair deal,” observes Ananta Prasad, Communications Officer, Hamara Bachpan campaign.', 'Creating awareness that facilitates advocacy to bring about change is the main focus of this campaign. Adds Prasad,', 'Initially, the community did question our existence but through street plays and meetings with parents we managed to convince them that we were interested in bringing about change at the policy level that would enable them to have better living conditions, increased opportunities and so on.', 'Empowering children with knowledge and giving them a voice has produced encouraging results. Sasmita Mohanty, 10, a Class Three student from Salia Sahi slum of Bhubaneswar, is a child club leader who has made a significant contribution in her locality. After the tragic death of a seven-year-old girl, who was raped and murdered few months ago, a very disturbed Sasmita gathered her friends and went to meet the Commissioner of Police, R.K. Sharma, the very next day, demanding more street lights and a dedicated police outpost in their area. Not only did Commissioner Sharma listen to the children – incidentally, they were not accompanied by any adults, including their parents – but this interaction led to increased police patrolling. Further, working street lights have been installed in the neighbourhood as well.', 'Besides safety, Sasmita has raised the issue of access to education and a curb on child labour. What has given her efforts – and that of other child leaders – a definite boost are the upcoming elections. As the activists of Hamara Bachpan campaign motivated them to create a Children’s Manifesto, the club kids responded wholeheartedly. Remarks Preeti Prada, National Campaign Coordinator, Humara Bachpan,', 'No political party has directly spoken of or considered the issues related to children, who comprise 40 per cent of the population. We have tried to empower them to become the watchdogs of urban development policies. As citizens, their well being should also be on the agenda of political parties.', 'So what is this Children’s Manifesto all about? “We want all political parties to support and create provisions to make Odisha a child-friendly state, by including the following demands in their political manifestoes,” reads the document. What are these demands? The charter calls for ensuring urban development schemes like RAY and JnNURM are revised in the best interest of children, that there is adequate access to clean drinking water, sanitation facilities, a pollution-free living environment, proper electricity supply, well-ventilated housing and adequate recreational spaces. Other demands include participation of children at every phase of the planning process for better living conditions, an increase in government allocation for children’s well being and, most importantly, a zero tolerance policy towards child labour.', 'Of course, when the Hamara Bachpan child leaders presented the Children’s Manifesto to the local politicians at a recent meeting, as intended, it had a serious impact. When Sajjan Sharma, a local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, read through the document he relialised that this was no ordinary initiative. According to him, “The voices raised from this forum are those that we have as yet been neglecting. We have deprived them of their rights and it is high time that this situation changes.” Representatives from other political parties including Pratap Jena of Congress, Nishikant Mohapatra of Aam Admi Party (AAP), Hemant Rath of Kalinga Sena and Suresh Panigrahy of Communist Party of India (Marxist) have had similar reactions. Says Nishikant Mohapatra,', 'I do admit that the children have raised the right points. They are our future and we can’t afford to overlook them. By raising their voice they have raised our hopes for a better tomorrow. There is positive change waiting to happen and these alert children are going to make it happen.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Now Get Ready To Visit The Warli Tribe & Listen To Their Music.']","['\n\n\nby\n\nGangadharan Menon\n\n\nApril 10, 2014, 10:12 pm \n\n\n', 'Did my car slow down on its own near a house made of karvi sticks? Or did the muscle memory of my legs press on the brake ever so lightly? Whatever be the case, I had halted at the house of Anusuyabai, my host in the adivasi village of Walvanda.', 'And the moment I walked into her house, the sense of déjà vu became more intense. Her disarming smile told me that I have met her somewhere; and her warm, welcome house said that I have been to this house before. I walked straight into the inviting kitchen and took intimate photographs of her utensils and fireplace, dimly lit by the skylight on the roof. That’s when I realized why Warlis paint in white on the brown walls inside their houses. It’s for the figures to catch light, as colours would have merged into the darkness.', 'When we took part in various village activities, in different houses, it dawned on me that despite not having a caste division (they were all Warlis here), there was a clear division of labour. So there was the village blacksmith, the tailor, the cattle-rearer, the hunter-gatherer, the farmer, the fisherman, and even an expert who had the perfect antidote for treating poison bites.', 'But what amazed me was that none of the implements that were being used here were ‘bought’. They were all made by them. And necessity being the mother of invention, you could see innovation at its best. So there were separate baskets made of bamboo in two unique shapes. One for catching fish, and another strange-looking one for catching crabs! Then for trapping raptors, they had a quiver that had the resin of the mahua tree. This resin would be applied on short bamboo sticks and then laid out on a straw mat in a haphazard way around the bait. The unsuspecting bird would land on the sticky sticks to lift off its prey and would get stuck on them, never to fly free again.', 'An example of their innate intelligence was seen when my wife got a bee sting. When Waman, our guide, saw her hand swelling up, in one swift move he pulled out the tiny sting. Then he went into the nearby forest from where he plucked the leaves of two local plants: Burada and Tarota. He squeezed out the juice of the leaves and applied it on the sting. And hey presto, in minutes the inflammation was gone!', 'In one of the typical Warli houses, the walls were made of Karvi sticks tied together and the roof was made of tiles. This house was much cooler than the concrete structures nearby which were like ovens. But somehow such simple houses were being looked down upon and were being replaced with modern monstrosities. So much for ‘progress’.', 'In the evening, we walked to the river. As we walked, on either side we saw golden farmlands ready for harvest. And the bizarre sight of scare-crows made of Kurkure packets. Another contribution of ‘civilization’ to the simple, pastoral life of the villages.', 'When I started looking for Warli artists in this village, I was told there were none. The last of them had taken up farming long ago. But I did get to see a Warli painting done on the wall of a house where there was a wedding recently. But it was not a work of art but more like a ritual; very rudimentary. That’s when it occurred to me that there’s no art if there’s no market. In the nearby town of Jawhar and the faraway Palghar, there’s a flourishing market for Warli paintings which makes young artists take up this art form as a source of livelihood.', 'And I remembered the words of Inir Pinheiro, the founder of Grassroutes that has been promoting village tourism with a missionary zeal for the last eight years. He had once told me, ‘We city folks should earn in the city and spend in the villages. That’s one way we can help the villagers earn their livelihood right here without migrating to cities looking for jobs. It’s when we come and live with them that we understand the joys of their simple living. This will even help them preserve their beautiful traditions, culture, music and art, as they greatly value our appreciation.’', 'This rang true all the more when I met Bhiklya Ladkya Dinda, the master of the tarpa which is a wind instrument unique to the Warlis. He was not a mere musician; he was a philosopher too. Taking a masterclass on his favourite tarpa (he had three of them), he first explained the intricacies of the two bamboo pipes. One he calls a female, and that produces treble. And the one he calls a male produces bass. Thus probably making it the only wind instrument with both treble and bass in the instrument itself! Then with a twinkle in his septuagenarian eyes, he said: ‘It needs a male and a female to make great music!’', 'For the next 30 minutes he went into a trance and played such divine music that I felt fortunate to be living on this earth. There was a lilt and a rhythm inbuilt in his music, which made up for the absence of percussion, and he gently swayed to a beat that only he could hear.', 'When I asked him if he sold these wonderful tarpas that he makes, he said that a musician has to make his own instrument. And not play on one made by another. To him each tarpa is as unique as the individual, and you should make one of your own that reverberates with your soul. Then, and only then, will great music flow out of it.', 'Later in the night, youngsters had gathered at the village square for the Sarvajanik celebrations. There, on the stage, the master of the tarpa got only 15 minutes of fame. The rest of the night was hogged by, you guessed it, item numbers from the omnipresent Bollywood.', 'The next day, on our way to the waterfall nearby, we had to cross the Jambha river. There we saw two Warli boys frolicking in the water. The older one of them was singing a Warli folk song; and soon his younger friend joined in. It was indeed music to my ears, as I saw a glimmer of hope there for the musical tradition of the Warlis. A fond hope that eventually the tarpa will win over Bollywood. At least in their village.', 'How to get there: Walvanda is about 120 kms from Mumbai. Take the Western Express Highway to Manor. Then take the road to Vikramgadh. Walvanda is 13 kms from here on the Jawhar Road.', 'Where to stay: At the camp site of Grassroutes.

This was the first project of its kind undertaken in India, thus creating history.

A dental patient came in and asked whether I had a tour to Tirupati. When I told her about my breast cancer treatment, she stood up and left the clinic thinking cancer is a communicable disease. People are literate today but they still have misconceptions. So, in order to spread awareness, I used my passion for travelling and began this mission.', 'What was the reaction of the people in your awareness workshops and how much are people aware of breast cancer, which is considered as “taboo” in our country?', 'Ritu: Different reactions came. Initially people asked: Tumhara breast nikal diya gaya kya? (Did they remove your breast?) Whether it’s urban or rural, 90% women are unaware of breast cancer symptoms and 70-80% about cervical, oral and other cancer in the country. People In the tribal areas were very receptive. In six months journey, I held 140 workshops where 26,000 people attended, covering 30,220 Kms in 177 days, including 26 states.', 'Were men also receptive in the same way and what problems you faced during the journey?', 'Ritu: Cancer doesn’t discriminate. I included graphics, pictures to engage people and when I used to tell the men that 1% of males also get breast cancer, they used to listen with more interest.', 'I have traveled in and know rural and tribal conditions very well from my stint in the Indian Army as Captain (1982-92). So we had only challenges and not problems in front of us. We slept without beds, stayed in tribal homes and not hotels – it was all part of the journey.', 'What are your future plans? Shall we expect to see another pan-India awareness campaign?', 'Ritu: Well, for now workshops are being conducted in corporate, schools, MBA colleges, hospitals and Army camps. In 2010, we had our first International awareness workshop, and for the time being we are focusing on more cancer drives nationally and internationally.', 'What was your source of funding and how were you supported?', 'Ritu: Our journey was sponsored by a company but we normally raise funds for our projects from people. Regarding support, if we are passionate about a mission, everyone supports us. So I have got immense support from my family, and wherever I have been, I have received amazing support from the natives and army.', 'What message you would like to give to youth, to come ahead and lead like you?', 'Ritu: Some lines I want to convey, as this is the motto of my life:\nEXPLORE…one’s own inner strengths and spirits\nTo UNLOCK and EXPAND…one’s own horizons\nSTEER through all odds and trying times…on the highways called life\nOVERCOME…the fear of unknown in one’s roller coaster quest\nEXPERIENCE…those exhilarating moments of going beyond\nTo CELEBRATE…the whole existence.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Paul Sathianathan, Chief Executive Officer, GUARDIAN and understand that ‘defecation’ may not be something that we like to talk about but is an important area of concern. He believes:', 'Controlling open defecation in a country is not just a huge social cause and service but also a big step towards a healthy environment. And anyone who can contribute towards this cause is actually playing a big part towards the building of the nation. Open defecation is rampant in almost every village despite the existence of community structures at some places.', 'Paul says the problem lies in the traditional mind set of the community. “We need to sensitise and educate the community on the dangers associated with open defecation. Issues like how the faecal matter contaminates the water bodies, problems in collecting water from the public stand posts, inadequate water for family needs and problems faced by adolescent girls in search of hiding places for defecation need to be discussed with the people.” Group meetings, interactive sessions and campaigns are the tools that can be used to spread awareness, “Frequent interaction with the communities through meetings at their villages can bring about a change.”', 'Paul worked in a government sector for more than two decades before working with Gramalaya for five years. In 2007, he was appointed as the CEO of GUARDIAN. He has had an exposure on micro credit operations at BASIX, Hyderabad & urban and rural sanitation in Bangladesh with WaterAid.

The scale of operations and the superlative management of resources is straight out of an MBA case study!', 'Chances are summertime paeans are unheard of in many districts of Maharashtra, the third largest state in the country. Reason: summers do not portray a picture one would like to sing about. They are anything but picturesque. A merciless sun, parched lands, not a sight of greenery, abandoned fields, dried up dams and wells, long serpentine queue of women, children and men waiting for water tankers, idle farmers taking refuge in cattle camps and a general pall of gloom is what one gets to see in an otherwise bountiful state, which is one of the country’s biggest producers of sugar, pulses, cotton and soybeans.', 'Maharashtra has been facing drought for more than four decades and it’s been only getting worse each year. Last year, in 2013, Maharashtra faced one of the worst droughts in more than four decades affecting nearly everyone after receiving less than 50 percent of the average rainfall during the last two monsoon seasons. Marathwada region was worst-hit with water levels in big dams falling rapidly. January 2012 had recorded 43% live water storage in dams of Marathwada compared to only 13% in January 2013. By March 2013, it had reduced to 8%, and by May 2013 majority of lakes – small and big – had gone dry.', 'Not many have experienced the abject reality of drought like Shantilal Muttha. For Shantilal, the Founder & National President of Pune-based NGO Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana (BJS), was born in Dongarkinhi village in Patoda taluka of Beed district, an area that is severely drought prone owing to rocky terrain and little top soil. Water scarcity aggravates the situation further, hampering agriculture and crop produce.', 'What makes this district unique is that it has the largest number of seasonal migrants as compared to other regions of India, who are forced to relocate to sugarcane factories to work as sugarcane cutters for a living. The relocation also hampers the education of children, who accompany their parents, although government-run temporary schools – Sahakar Shalas – try to fill up the gap. Till day, the situation in Beed has remained pretty much the same, resulting in little socio-economic growth.', 'As a child, Shantilal had experienced the adversities of migration as his family moved to the sugarcane factory in Pravara area for putting up a shop supplying provisions. He had closely observed the hardships that men and especially women encountered as they toiled hard, along with their young children. So, when the Marathwada region was once again on the brink of drought last year, Shantilal decided it was time for him to do something about it.', 'To their shock, he and his team found the situation was far grim than they had envisaged — for the first time in the past several years the Godavari basin area and several of its water bodies – village lakes, minor and medium irrigation projects, and percolation tanks, were going completely dry. The situation had reached intolerable levels. Poor monsoons or absence of adequate water conservation measures would mean further losses to the people, who were already languishing in scarcity.', 'On February 26, 2013, he called a meeting of all Maharashtra State BJS office bearers to take stock of the situation and draw out an action plan for drought relief intervention. Shantilal got his team to conduct a quick survey of the district, which revealed that water sources for villagers – small lakes and tanks that have existed or been constructed since the past 40-50 years – were packed with silt.', 'Absence of any desilting measures had resulted in reduced water storage capacities and also hampered ground water recharge process. He and his team went through a research paper published by the Maharashtra Engineering and Research Institute (MERI) of the Water Resources Department, Nashik, which corroborated the fact that Marathwada faced high siltation rates compared to the rest of Maharashtra. The paper highly recommended desiltation both for increased water storage and for using the nutrient-filled silt for improving soil fertility.', 'Armed with knowledge, technical guidance from PriMove Infrastructure Development Consultants, and cooperation of the District Collector of Beed, BJS surveyed all small lakes, medium irrigation projects and percolation tanks in the Ashti, Patoda, Shirur, Beed and Gevrai talukas of Beed district. It identified 125 such water bodies that needed to be desilted and launched a massive campaign.', 'The daunting task needed to be carried out on war footing and accomplished in a month’s time – before the advent of monsoons. For this purpose, Shantilal himself shifted residence to Dongarkinhi, along with his team from the BJS head office in Pune, and stayed there for a month. He went from village to village, held meetings with the Sarpanchs and villagers, to garner support and participation of people in carrying the silt from the sites to their fields.', 'Hundreds of BJS volunteers in the area were seen working late into the night. Around 100 JCB and 35 Poclain excavators were brought from Aurangabad, Beed, Pune and Mumbai. Around 150 staffers of BJS’ Value Education Project shouldered various responsibilities in and around the sites. BJS’ nodal office in Dongarkinhi monitored the daily reports sent by its staff via SMS texts.', 'Several excavators worked 24/7 and any difficulties arising in the field were handled efficiently by its well-set management system. The cooperation of the District Collector, Tehsildar, the Zilla Parishad and the irrigation/ water resources authorities also provided a much-needed shot in the arm of the Desilting Campaign.', 'Simultaneously, Shantilal kept a close eye on the other part of drought relief operations – setting up cattle camps (Chaara Chhavni) since March 18 to deal with the most pressing and urgent issue of cattle care and protection in drought-prone areas. Within a fortnight of setting up camps, 30 such camps were established in seven districts of the worst affected region of Marathwada, thus creating home for 10,000 cattle.', 'The BJS volunteers, who committed themselves for this activity, were provided the necessary training in cattle-camp management by experts. Care was taken to lab-test fodder for its nutritive content before procuring it. Specially prepared cattle feed and mineral mixture was added to the cattle diet, and two train-loads of 1500 metric tons of fodder was purchased and transported from Madhya Pradesh to Maharashtra and sent to the various camps on April 13. BJS also arranged for insurance cover for every animal and every camp. The project emerged as an ideal model for running and managing cattle camps.', 'Out of the 115 water bodies that were undertaken for desilting, work was fully completed in 85 of them out of which 15 were done manually. Work in 30 large water bodies, though incomplete, had to be stopped due to rains.', 'In all, about 20 lakh cubic metres of silt was excavated. About 2500 hectare of land received the silt and the cumulative water storage capacity was increased by 20 lakh cubic metres.', 'Finally, on June 11, 2013, the campaign ended with a celebratory event to acknowledge and recognize the hard work put in by hundreds of volunteers, who worked day and night to make the intervention successful. Pre-monsoon showers hit the region in the first week of June and water started accumulating.', 'BJS’s success with the Desilting Campaign has shown the way for others.

Kiran now wants to undertake something similar in Uttarakhand and take forward the good work of the Good Samaritans.', 'Dr Sripriya, Joby Joseph and Major (Retd) Jamnal were extremely forthcoming and enthusiastic in sharing their treasure of knowledge and inputs on conduct of medical camp in Uttarakhand.', 'In Feb 2014, Kiran Patel flew down from UK to Uttarakhand, did extensive reconnaissance of various locations, had detailed interactions with Major (Retd) Jamnal, local NGOs, Mr Shekar Babu (the erstwhile Disaster Commissioner in his new avatar as DC of Uttarkashi) and went back making up his mind. His Foundation has now decided to organize a 10 day long medical camp in the last week of May 2014 at two locations, Muri and Purola in Uttarkashi Distt – a golden opportunity for aspiring volunteers.', 'There is a great sense of satisfaction that the good work done by the Chennai Doctors Team is being accepted and taken forward by new groups of good Samaritans from distant lands thus bringing in continuity to the whole effort.', 'Finally, about a promised commitment that is yet to be accomplished. The Chennai Doctors Team was approached by Anand Mohan and Pushpa Badoni, a local volunteer couple, to adopt and support their educational venture – one close to their hearts. They are in the process of establishing and running Sridev Suman Educational Academy, a quality English Medium School in remote Bhatwari. Unfortunately they are unable to fulfill their dream for want of financial resources.', 'The Chennai Doctors Team did ponder about it a couple of times. The whole project involves reconstituting the Trust with a clearer vision, a committed team to take it forward, fund mobilization to the tune of a couple of crores, running it smoothly for a few years, and so on. The complexities involved are beyond the existing capabilities and commitments of the Chennai Doctors Team. For them, it still remains an unfulfilled commitment. Perhaps another set of philanthropists may offer to take this project to its logical end?

Think of water – the surface appearance of which is smooth glass – catching the sunlight with a shimmer here and a glitter there, only disturbed by floating yellow marigolds and extinguished diyas; hordes of people lining the ghats, sinking into the shimmering water as if being eaten whole, to wash away their sins and the day’s collective grime, eyes closed in deep devotion. Floral notes from incense sticks mingle with the fragrance of fried foods, steaming kulhad chai and a faint, distant smell of burning, tying the scene together neatly.', 'That’s Banaras for you – one of the oldest living cities in the world.', 'One part of Banaras’s story is on its ghats, where people of all religions gather for the evening aarti or to absolve their misdemeanours and evil. The other is in its streets – the city thrives in its vast network of narrow lanes lined with shops on both sides and bustling thoroughfare in the middle.', 'There are stories everywhere you look – the erstwhile royal palaces by the ghats that are now home to regular families with regular lives; ancestral homes that double up as storehouses for the locally-made Banarasi fabrics; and temples that make wishes come true. In fact, there’s a story behind the city’s better-known name too – two rivers, Varuna and Assi, come together at this point, so the city that evolved by its banks got christened ‘Varanasi’. When the Mughal rulers came, they brought the name ‘Banaras’ with them.', 'Watching the evening aarti is an experience in itself, but to witness it from a boat on the Ganga is an enchanting experience. The boatsmen drive a hard deal, finally carrying you to a vantage point from where the aarti can best be experienced. Bit by bit, more boats come closer to each other and people begin to rock restlessly as other boats block their view. When the prayers start and the (good-looking) (Forgive me, God)\xa0pundits begin with their bells and prayers, the sounds drift out into the dark night over the gentle lapping of the waves and silence even the most noisy feet jumping across boats like monkeys.', 'The aarti goes on for a good 45 minutes, after which the people gathered purchase diyas, bind their hopes and dreams and wishes to the burning flame and let them drift off into the vast darkness of the Ganga. And while the prayers go on on one side of the ghat, pyres glow in the darkness on the other as families watch their loved ones turn to ashes.', 'A boat ride on the Ganga will reveal that the burning ghats are not too far away. “Kehte hain, yahan ki chita kabhi nahi bujhti” (It is said that a pyre lighted here never extinguishes), a local told us, referring to the number of cremations that happen on a daily basis. Although seeing a dead body float by was one of my greatest aversions to visiting Banaras, I didn’t spot a single one – not even at the burning ghats. Death is a profitable business here.', 'History doesn’t just live in Banaras – you can see traces of it in the places around the city too. A trip to Sarnath will acquaint one with the birthplace of Buddha. Sarnath is a quiet town – except for the bustle of tourists, mostly from other Asian countries – but quite unremarkable otherwise, considering it’s home to one of the biggest religious forces in the world. Ramnagar Fort, on the other hand, is a quaint, pretty place with an impressive collection of vintage cars, clocks, and pictures. Unfortunately, little care is taken to maintain the fort and its historic treasures – layers of dust rest on most things. The architecture’s a mix of a couple of styles, of which old-world Kolkata is the most evident. Somehow, this mélange of styles also comes together to create a distinct flavour in the cuisine of Banaras.', 'Chaats are a must-try in Banaras. The Tamaatar chaat, unique to the city (at least as far as I know), is made of a thick and spicy tomato gravy topped with tiny fried Bengal-gram bits, coriander, masalas, a tablespoon of Ghee and sugar syrup. It’s like the Fourth of July fireworks in your mouth, with layer after layer of flavours bursting forth. Food as a rule is rich and lip-smackingly good in Banaras, and is best washed-down with a Kulhad chai (tea in an earthen container) from one of the road-side stalls.', 'In the three days I spent in Banaras – well, two-and-a-half actually because our train was delayed by 10 hours – my senses were on overdrive: there’s so much to taste and experience and absorb, so much to learn about culture and history. And if this is how much I have learned in such a short time, I can’t wait to go back and see how much more I can get to know over a week.', 'Getting there: There are direct flights to Banaras from most metros. The alternative is to take a train/bus from Delhi. The train journey is picturesque, but please avoid the Gharib Rath – it is ridiculously late at all times.', 'Go if: You want to soak in history, wash away your sins, want to experience culture, love stories, love colours, and love food.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Now, here we have someone who has dared to replace ‘mental disability’ with ‘employability’ – Madhumita Puri, Founder of Society for Child Development. It’s indeed an endeavour that has hearteningly pushed the boundaries of limitation to claim new territories.', 'Madhumita was working as a clinical psychologist in the genetics department of a hospital in Delhi. She happened to frequently see parents who were being given the news of disability of their children. That was the beginning of a long journey for the parents. But Madhumita started to feel that as doctors, they were looking at the issue with a narrow perspective. The issue at hand was more a social issue than a medical one. She thought she could probably do more if she went out of her medical job to don the role of an enabler for these children and their parents. She quit her job way back in 1992 and took to work on her calling. That was the beginning of Society for Child Development.', 'The Society started a school and training centre in that part of Delhi where facilities such as this were not available for marginalized families. The idea was to take a life span approach through early childhood, school education, skill development, life skills and shelter care for young adults who have no families or have been abandoned by their families. She roped in doctors and educators to become part of the society.', 'In the beginning, there was a good inflow of donations, but that couldn’t be a sustainable roadmap in the long run. Also, Madhumita started realizing that there was a glass ceiling which they reached even by providing the children with education. The children suffered from severe mental challenges and education and training becomes insufficient after a point. The parents lose interest in sending their children to school. Was it possible to crack through this ceiling?', 'The challenges were to look beyond education, encourage parents to send their children to the school and reduce dependency on donations. And as serendipity had it, Madhumita was struck by a beautiful idea.', 'During one of their efforts to clean the surroundings of their vocational centre, they wanted to dispose the flower waste from a temple into a nearby lake. Shockingly they found that the lake was chokingly polluted and she brought the flowers back. This got her thinking, can we make good use of these flowers? There are tons of flowers from temples in India that get dumped into garbage. Can these be utilized in some way? Natural Holi colours, came the answer.', 'She got the ball rolling at the Society for ‘Trash to Cash’ – recycling trashed flowers which will reap economic benefits for challenged young adults above the age of 18. Skill development began for the children to recycle the flowers to produce natural and non-toxic Holi colours. Selling these colours, the Society was able to start paying the wards a stipend for their work.', 'For these young adults, this exercise offered a calming and aromatic effect, a sense of achievement and the unlocking of rewarding experiences. For parents, it was an unexpected sense of empowerment to see their children earn a living and often a great economic support. In some families, these children are the sole earning members. In recognition of the impact that the ‘Trash to Cash’ initiative has created, the United Nations awarded the Society for Inclusive Entrepreneurial Business.', 'Madhumita walks every morning into the SCD centre to see over a hundred enabled youth. Here, there is never a dull moment and the perception of a sorrowful fate vanishes into thin air. The children and youth at the centre are accomplished, they have liaised a gentle relationship with the dogs that are sheltered at the centre, and they know that it is serious business that they are doing. They have made a business out of flower trash and expanded to weaving, newspaper recycling, agarbathi making and bag making.', 'They value the notes handed over to them at the end of every month and they also know that they should not disappear from work. Madhumita has taught them that ‘if you don’t give, it’s not dignified to get’. This work ethics is so strongly engraved in their minds that some parents complain that their children refuse to take a day off from work and accompany them to go elsewhere!', 'Madhumita’s commitment, imagination, innovation and beyond all that her belief that there can be a better life for the mentally challenged, has carved out a new world for these children and their families. Madhumita is planning to take this change to more cities – Bangalore, Chennai, Ajmer, Jaipur and Kolkata will soon see more empowered and distinctly abled children.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

But, what will you call these real-life unsung heroes who have selflessly dedicated their lives to saving and nurturing animals in India? We suggest, let’s not typecast them. For their work and humanity are the best introduction they could or should ever have. While there are several renowned organizations working for the welfare of animals, these citizens are one-man (or one-woman) armies who have stood by their cause and have helped countless animals survive.

She is Dorothy Ghosh. Everything was perfect in her life – a job to die for, a neat pay package and a comfortable routine. If something is to be blamed to spoil all of that, it has to be her passion to rescue dogs and cats. Well, not really. She might have lost a so-called convenient set-up of her life but only to gain a lot of love, respect and admiration.', 'It was her compassion for animals that pushed her to start a shelter for them and Kalyani Animal Welfare Foundation (NGO) came into being in 2010. But it wasn’t as easy for her as it sounds. Ghosh had no option but to spend all her savings to collect funds and thereon, take a land on 5-year lease in Village Bhati in Delhi. Apart from a few private donors, she gets no aid from the government and her mother donates her entire pension to bear the rent. From collecting funds to buying medicine to cleaning the premises, both mother and daughter manage every single bit at the shelter all by themselves.', 'Just like Ghosh, there’s another gutsy lady who chose not to tie the nuptial knot and instead dedicate her life to the furry friends. Nita Seth, who lives in Defence Colony, is in her 60s and is caretaker for over 40 dogs and cats and all of them reside alongside her. She has been in this noble service for over 20 years now.

AjayDeep Singh and Samita Sharma are not just married to each other but also to their heartfelt cause of saving dogs and giving them a new life. And they are upholding their passion from their residence in Faridabad.', 'The couple has been turning savior for pedigrees and dogs who are lost or, at times, run away from home. They treat them, get the fear out of their minds, make them fit for adoption and get them re-adopted. And since the times they decided to take up this noble duty, the two haven’t been on a vacation. AjayDeep is a well-read professional, an IT Consultant and despite his daily chores, he manages to give time to the adopted kids. Often discouraged by neighbours and people who don’t feel for animals, the man and wife on a mission have never let it become a hurdle in their way of goodness.', 'Not very different is the story of Nadir Khan and his wife Pia Sethi, who feed almost 1,800 dogs in Sector 56, 57 of Sushant Lok, Gurgaon. Apart from dogs, they also attend to other stray animals such as cattle and injured birds. Their routine has both travelling to various spots where dogs often wait for them to get fed. All the dogs at these places are vaccinated against rabies and are sterilized by them. Their noble cause has been inspiring enough for other NGOs in the area to supply them with free medical aid as the couple usually ends up spending most of their earnings on their selfless deed. They too, like AjayDeep and Samita, have given shelter to few of the dogs at their home. It is indeed a ‘Home Sweet Home’ for a lot of lives breathing in the National Capital Region, thanks to the kind-hearted couples.', 'The pledge, cause, kindness, passion to protect, make lives thrive… one often thinks, what could be the reason for their relentless efforts? And the answer echoes loud and clear. For every cruel action, there’s goodness waiting to nullify it. Despite several Indian laws in place for protecting animals, many Indians still disregard the idea of their peaceful existence alongside the concrete society. Time and again notices are issued; circulars are distributed to remind mankind of their duty towards the voiceless. Recently, the Animal Welfare Board of India also released a notice that said, “Street dogs cannot be beaten and driven away from localities, it is their right to live in the same place where they have taken birth.” There is also no law that prohibits feeding of street animals. In fact, citizens who go out of their way to feed the strays are performing a compassionate duty under the Constitution of India.', 'The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 has also been long in existence but does a majority of India really abide by it is still a big question mark. Nevertheless, these selfless, unperturbed souls with noble intentions sure look determined to change quite a few mindsets, and they are the reason why India is indeed a better place.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
