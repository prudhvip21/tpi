0,2013-4,"['Archives', 'TBI Social Enterprise: Disruptive Innovations Bring On ‘The Female Sanitary Revolution’']","['Since generations, the topic of menstruation has been treated as taboo in India and several other parts of the world. This ensured that there was very little discussion and innovation in the field. However, thanks to the efforts of several courageous women and men, the ‘female sanitary revolution’ has finally arrived!', 'Every 28 days across the globe, at least a quarter of the world’s population menstruates. Despite this being one of life’s most natural occurrences, for millions of girls and women across Asia, Africa, Central and South America the high cost of sanitary napkins ensures menstruation is a significant challenge.', 'The inability to afford sanitary napkins during menstruation means that many of the world’s low-income women are forced to use primitive alternatives, such as newspaper, rags of cloth, bark, ashes, banana leaves, hay or mud, which are both ineffective and unhygienic. All too often these alternatives lead to long-term health risks such as Reproductive Tract Infections, Toxic Shock Syndrome or Cervical Cancer.', 'The medical implications and unpredictability of alternative sanitation methods, coupled with the widespread societal taboo of menstruation, frequently results in girls skipping school and women missing work. Research indicates that girls in several developing countries miss up to 50 school days annually due to menstruation – in rural India alone a shocking 300 million girls and women are under monthly house arrest.', 'For the average woman living in poverty the lost work due to ineffective menstruation options amounts to five years of unearned wages over a lifetime – income that could otherwise be put towards much needed family healthcare, education or food expenses.', 'While new product, service and process innovations in a variety of sectors have resulted in lowered costs for many widely used healthcare products, the humble sanitary napkin continues to remain prohibitively priced.', 'In a May 2012 TED talk, Arunachalam Muruganantham, also known as the ‘Menstrual Man’ in India, mentioned that there are limited innovations in menstrual products because the machinery necessary to convert fiber used in sanitary napkins into absorbent cellulose costs more than half a million U.S. dollars. For most entrepreneurs this is simply an unmanageable cost, despite the potential long-term social and commercial impact.', 'Now, more than ever, the global sanitary napkin industry is ripe for disruption. The emergence of various innovations across the globe addressing the high-cost – and subsequent health and income risks – of sanitary napkins signals that the ‘Female Sanitary Revolution’ is gaining momentum.', 'In India specifically, Muruganantham and his company Jayaashree Industries is a strong example of the growing ‘Female Sanitary Revolution’. Recognizing that the root cause of sanitary napkin expense is the fixed production cost, he has created a sanitary napkin-making machine to produce quality products at a lower cost to the consumer.', 'Muruganantham said that his investigation into sanitary napkins began when he realized that his wife used rags during her periods, as buying napkins meant no milk for the family. He tried various techniques for creating a viable sanitary napkin alternative but lacked willing research candidates as neither his wife, nor the girls at the local medical college, would give him honest feedback.', 'Finally, after using goat’s blood and a plastic bag as an alternative uterus, Muruganatham developed a pilot handmade pad, which he then distributed for free to college students for test subjects. Gathering insights from the pilot, Muruganantham was able to develop a simple machine to make viable sanitary napkins.', 'Today the Jayaashree Industries sanitary napkin machine is powered by electricity and foot pedals and can make 1,000 napkins a day for as little as Rs 16 per 8-pack. However, rather than selling the sanitary products commercially, Jayaashree Industries helps rural women buy one of the machines, at a cost of approximately Rs 80,000, through NGOs, government loans and rural self-help groups.', 'This approach has enabled the creation of multiple women micro-entrepreneurs now empowered to create awareness about the benefits of using sanitary napkins, thereby increasing the impact of Jayaashree’s innovation. Since inception, Jayaashree Industries has sold more than 745 machines across 23 Indian states resulting in approximately 3.5 million women now wearing comfortable and safe sanitary napkins.', 'Another early-stage Indian enterprise, Azadi, is also well placed to disrupt the sanitary napkin industry with their product. Azadi has developed a 100% biodegradable sanitary napkin that is 43% cheaper than the average retail price point. As a result of the high commercial and social potential of their innovation, the Founders, Dhirendra Pratap Singh and Ameet Mehta, have already raised US $115,000 from angel investors and Chicago-based incubator, The Impact Engine.', 'Recognizing that reaching low-income markets can be challenging, Azadi plans to distribute through two main channels; selling to organisations that already have access to rural distribution networks as well as harnessing a network of Indian female entrepreneurs to sell the pads themselves through a franchise model. The company is now piloting operations in collaboration with Development Association for Human Advancement to recruit and train 100 female entrepreneurs in the Bahraich and Shrawasti District of Uttar Pradesh to begin selling Azadi products.', 'By forming profitable partnerships with local organisations to market, manufacture and sell affordable pads to their communities, Azadi believes that the impact of their innovation can be multiplied with each partnership having the potential to change 100,000 lives. In five years, Azadi aims to build a network of over 13,000 female entrepreneurs who will directly reach 4 million rural girls and women.', 'Beyond India, a number of forward-thinking approaches exist to address the sanitary napkin challenge through for-profit innovations.', 'Ugandan based startup AFRIpads enlists unemployed Ugandan women to manufacture low-cost reusable cloth sanitary pads, which are uniquely sold as part of a menstrual kit containing a holder, pads and bags for used napkins. These kits are priced at approximately 20% of the total cost of a one-year supply of commercial sanitary napkins. Moreover, since the pads are washable and can be reused for up to one year the product is both affordable and environmentally friendly.', 'A further low-cost alternative to sanitary napkins is the menstrual cup – a cost-effective sanitation solution that can be reused for a period of 10 years.', 'Kenya is a global leader in the menstrual cup solution, having done an accessibility study of the acceptance of the innovation in low-income communities. Recognizing this, early-stage enterprise Ruby Cup established themselves in 2011 and developed a menstrual cup both leveraging the insights from the study and through direct product development. Ruby Cup is now partnering with NGO networks across Africa to distribute their product and has recently started to sell Ruby Cup at conventional retail outlets, such as pharmacies. Ruby Cup also sells the product worldwide through its online shop.', 'From these innovations, it can be seen that to create a world where 100% of women use sanitary menstrual solutions, the key challenge, especially in India continues to be distribution. Both Azadi and Jayaashree Industries demonstrate that for the impact of affordable sanitary napkins to be maximized, the focus needs to be on partnerships with local organisations.', 'AFRIpads and Ruby Cup further showcase the need for solutions that are not only affordable but also environmentally sustainable. Both, the re-usable menstrual kit and the menstrual cup are long-term solutions that will not create new problems of waste disposal and pollution for communities that adopt them.', 'Importantly, all of these innovations recognize that to fuel the ‘Female Sanitary Revolution’ it is necessary to educate and empower women. Whether it be by training unemployed women to make menstrual kits or by going a step further and setting up women-led micro enterprises that market, manufacture and sell sanitary napkins, these organisations are slowly changing the perception that women should be ashamed about menstruation.', 'To ensure that the ‘Female Sanitary Revolution’ continues to gain momentum, it is vital that the business models of early-stage organisations such as Azadi, AFRIpads and Ruby Cup be refined and developed so that they can be scaled globally. Innovation accelerators play an important role in this regard as they provide the integrated support of mentors, investors and experts required to grow operations and scale impact.', 'Despite the challenges, it is heartening to note that the ‘Female Sanitary Revolution’ has indeed started. These solutions both enable women to better manage their menstruation, and empower them to freely pursue life’s opportunities and contribute actively to the social and economic growth of their communities.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

The journey has been a long one and not without its share of challenges, but persistence and constant optimism and hard work to overcome challenges has reaped results in the last twenty years, informs Rajesh.', 'He further adds, “I come from a family of agriculturalists and this land is my ancestral land, which was written off as barren and of no use because of lack of water and the hard laterite rock structures making it very difficult for holding water and for the vegetation to grow. People thought I was taking a great risk when I shared my plan of developing this land and thought that it was impossible and that I was throwing away my career. However, I was determined to do something about it and that is how I gradually came upon the idea of first working on developing the water resources in the area”.', 'It took a lot of financial resources and time to create a lake that gradually started filling up with water and now it generates around 40,000 litres of water that is used for irrigating the whole farm. This has not only helped in creating and developing greenery in the area, but has also helped in increasing the water table in the surrounding areas of the farm. There is plenty of water in the two wells in the surrounding areas in the farm. Rajesh plans to and has already started working on creating another lake adjacent to the area of this lake. The earlier lake has now established itself, springs have already started appearing in the area.', 'It is very difficult to believe that this was a land that was once uncultivable, when one sees the two acre lake filled with water and the lush green vegetation surrounding the lake. Oddoor farms is one of the largest organic farms in the area with areca nut plantations spread across ten acres of land besides growing coconut, mangoes, haldi, pepper, bananas, cashew nuts, fruits and vegetables.\nCalves in the cattleshed from the Oddoor dairy near Mangalore', 'Besides growing fruits and vegetables, Rajesh has also started a diary farm that has around 200 cows that supply approximately 800 to 1000 litres of milk that is regularly taken up by the Karnataka Milk Federation. We look around at the cattle shed that houses the cows and separate ones for the calves. There is a big grass cutting machine in one of the sheds that provides the ample supply of green grass to the cattle. “We grow the grass on our own farm”, informs Rajesh, “and there is plenty of space here for the cattle to move around”.\nMethane gas generated from the biogas plant at Oddoor farms near Mangalore', 'The peculiarity of the farm is its self sufficiency in every aspect including manure production as well as electricity generated for the farm. The farm uses manure generated from cowdung and cow urine is used with other local herbal products to generate organic pesticides to take care of the pests on the farm. The cowdung and urine along with the wash water are collected in a tank, which after fermentation generates large amounts of methane, which is used to run a 60KV generator that produces its own electricity to run the whole farm. The biogas is also used for cooking. The slurry generated is used in the fields and is rich in minerals and calcium.', '“If this model can be replicated in every part of the country, the whole country will be able to take care of its water problems and will have agriculture totally based on organic farming. If I could do this on this piece of land, it can be replicated anywhere, what is important is the will of the people and the support from the government to do so”, signs off Rajesh.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
2,2013-4,"['Archives', 'Khurshid Chacha, I Won’t Ever Forget You']","['\n\n\nby\n\nYoginder Sikand\n\n\nApril 21, 2013, 10:58 pm \n\n\n', 'Yoginder Sikand introduces you to the renowned scholar Khurshid Kaimkhani. Chacha, as he was fondly called, lived an extraordinary life and strived hard to work for the betterment of the underprivileged Hindus and Muslims in Pakistan. Having been forced to leave his village in Rajasthan, Khurshid Chacha travelled extensively and even penned a book about his home town. Read on to know more about him and the inspirational life he lived.', 'It certainly seems uncanny, but I mustn’t think that it is anything other than a mere coincidence. Hardly sometime ago I penned an essay about him, suggesting that it was unlikely that we would ever meet again, for, given his age, it was improbable that he would come to India and I certainly didn’t want to go back to Sindh, where he lived. And then a few weeks later the Karachi-based Dawn announced his death, at the ripe age of 80. ‘Renowned Scholar Kaimkhani Dies’, reads a short notice in the paper.', 'A friend of mine from Sindh who also knew him called me on the phone to share the news. ‘Bechara,’ he said, ‘Bechara Chacha Kurshid has gone.’', '‘No, there’s nothing bechara about that, Bhai’ I replied. ‘He’s simply gone where he had to, and where all of us will soon go, too.’', 'Life wasn’t particularly easy for Khurshid Khan Kaimkhani. And so, maybe he was glad to finally go. His prolonged illness, which I didn’t realise was so serious till the day I heard about his demise, might well have made him want to get over with it all as soon as possible, and with the least amount of fuss.\nKhurshid Kaimkhani. Photo courtesy: Altaf Shaikh/Tehelka\nI can’t say that I knew him intimately, but we were close enough for me to call him ‘Chacha’.  From the little that I knew of him—through several days spent together over the years and numerous letters that we exchanged—it was apparent that he had suffered immensely almost throughout his life but also that it was this suffering that had led him on to do the amazing things that he did and to become the amazing man that he was.', 'Chacha could never reconcile himself to having been torn away from his home—in a village in Sikar, in present-day Rajasthan—and forced to shift to an alien land, to a ramshackle town in Sindh, by political big-wigs and religious bigots. That, I suppose, was at the root of his visceral allergy to nationalism and religion of all types and forms. His horror of both led him to resign from a fairly senior post in the Pakistani Army (which he had joined possibly simply because that was the sort of job what most Kaimkhanis, martial Chauhan Rajput converts to Islam, did for as long as they could remember) in protest against Pakistan’s brutalities against the East Bengalis in the name of God and Pakistani nationalism. He travelled abroad extensively after that—his father had left him a modestly-sized farm, the proceeds from which helped him fund his journeys—and this exposed him to ways of living and thinking that made him a true internationalist humanist.', 'He would come to India as often as he could get a visa. I know he wanted nothing more than go back to his village in Sikar and settle there, but I suppose he realized that there was no point in trying to reverse or defy history. He was convinced that religious orthodoxy and fundamentalism—Muslim as well as Hindu—posed a major threat to the peoples of our shared subcontinent, and was an enthusiastic supporter of better understanding between the peoples, as opposed to simply the governments, of India and Pakistan. He wrote much on that subject, and even penned a book, in Urdu, about the village where he was born, Sapno Ka Des (‘The Land of Dreams’), wherein he reflected on the futility and horrors of Partition and reminisced about the harmonious relations between Hindus and Muslims in his village when he was a child. I offered to translate it into English, as well as another book of his, Bhatakti Nasley (‘The Nomadic Races’), a collection of his articles on the Hindu Dalits and ‘low’ caste Muslims of Sindh.', 'Those were promises that I failed to fulfill. But I did keep up my promise to send him Indian Dalit literature, bits of which he translated into Sindhi and published in Dalit Adab, Pakistan’s first and only Dalit periodical, which he founded along with some Pakistani Dalit friends. He was one of the pioneers of the fledgling Ambedkarite movement among Pakistan’s three million Scheduled Castes. He was convinced that ‘low’ caste Muslims and Hindus (who, he argued, accounted for the majority of Indians and Pakistanis) were at one time a single people and that they should recover and celebrate the lost traditions of their long-forgotten ancestors–the inhabitants of the ten thousand year-old Indus Valley Civilisation in Sindh, where he lived. That, he firmly believed, was the most effective way to undermine the hatred in the name of religion that powerful sections among ‘upper’ caste Muslims and Hindus (both of whom he branded as descendants of foreign invaders) used in order to keep the ‘low’ castes of both countries and communities permanently divided. You might not agree entirely with Khurshid’s understanding of religion and history, but you can’t deny that his was a novel approach to Indo-Pak and Hindu-Muslim camaraderie.', 'Unlike some folks whose radicalism doesn’t go beyond rhetoric, the little that I saw of Khurshid indicated a man who lived pretty much as he preached. He had a modest home in Tando Allah Yar, not far from the Sindhi town of Hyderabad, where I visited him some years ago. His little farm, which he had inherited from his father, he had given to Balu, a Hindu Dalit and childhood friend, to manage. Over a dozen other impoverished Dalit families lived there, too, but they worked on other people’s lands. Khurshid had generously permitted them to live on his farm because elsewhere they may not have been safe and could easily have been targeted by dacoits or by dreaded landlords, whose word was law in interior Sindh. Khurshid and the Dalits on the farm were one large family, as was evident from the way they behaved with each other—joking and laughing and eating with each other and sitting together at night and singing songs of universal love by Kabir, Shah Abdul Latif and Mira Bai: quite unthinkable behavior for any ‘respectable’ Pakistani (or, for that matter, Indian) farm-owner.', 'One of the most moving memories that I have of Khurshid—and this rushes to my mind as I write these lines—was when we went out to the Dalit slum just beyond Tando Allah Yar. As we entered the locality of the Jogis—’low’ caste Hindu snake-charmers—a train of little children, undernourished and dressed in miserable rags, rushed out to greet him. He enveloped them in a giant hug. Then, he introduced me to his friends, pathetically impoverished Jogi men and women, with whom he spent much of his time. He showed me around the little Shiva temple at the corner of the locality. Some of the bells and statues inside he had brought back from his frequent trips to India.', 'He wasn’t at all, as far as I know, a believer in god—in any god for that matter—but he did see something akin to divinity in the children of his Dalit friends—the poorest of Pakistan’s desperately poor. ‘Look at them,’ I remember him saying to me, ‘What beautiful smiles! What innocent eyes! What poor souls, un-corrupted by hatred in the name of religion! How I wish I could kiss their feet.’', 'Khurshid Chacha, wherever you may now be, I promise you: I won’t ever forget you.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

We chat up with Dakshayini Gowda to learn how beautifully she blends education with jewellery to make this happen.\nDakshayini Gowda\nJust like most granddaughters Dakshayini Gowda too grew up admiring the jewels that belonged to her grandmother. “There was the jewellery in gold and occasionally in silver too,” she recalls. But that’s not what got her excited. In her grandmother’s chest also lay jewellery made out of seeds, flowers, leaves and other things that could be recycled. “These had no value in terms of money and they did not even shine but were simply awesome,” she adds.', 'No wonder she fell in love with all things inimitable, interesting and recyclable at a very young age. And so when her project, Sanchali, required financial aid to take the next step ahead, she found the help in her childhood memories. Sanchali, which means movement in Sanskrit, is involved in alternative teaching of history to school children, mainly focusing on the art and crafts of the Indus valley civilization.\n', 'They conduct workshops, especially for schools in rural areas, to reach out to as many children as possible. “These workshops are free because we feel that money should not be a constraint when it comes to learning,” she says. And funding these workshops is Sanchali’s eco-friendly jewellery project, which in turn also provides rural women with the opportunity of learning life skills that makes them financially independent and and increases their self-confidence. We join Dakshayini as she visits remote villages in the country and learn more about Sanchali.', 'Dakshayini holds a Bachelor degree in fine arts (sculpture) from Chitrakala Parishat, Bangalore and a Masters degree in Archaeology and Museology from Maharaja Sayajirao University, Baroda.', '“It was my academic background that gave me the idea to get involved in a social sanchaliproject. As a part of my Masters, I researched on the pottery, jewellery, textiles etc. of the Indus Valley civilization, which got me in touch with many artists/es like potters, block printers, craftsmen, etc. During the course of studying I found myself fascinated by the skills that were used by the artists/es back then and I realised how their skills and techniques were far ahead of their times,” she says, adding, “So I decided to take this particular aspect of history to the students to make both the subject interesting and widen their knowledge.” ', 'So she started creating ‘copies’ of the pieces so that the children could touch and feel each item, “I wanted them to do more than just look at the pictures in books or in glass cases in museums.” Sanchali’s workshops include games, drawings, puzzles, etc. that revolve around the subject.\n\n“We have created look-alikes of pottery, textile, beads, etc. of that period to give them a chance to learn history in a fun, interactive, lively and more effective manner,” she says. ', 'And since she wanted to ensure that the workshops were free for all, she decided to fund them by starting an eco-friendly jewellery project with the women in the villages in Karnataka.', '“It was during my numerous trips to remote villages that I learnt that regional and ancestral arts and crafts were being overshadowed by westernisation. These visits also sparked another idea, that of creating eco-friendly jewellery with the skill set of the rural woman, who were/are in possession of skills handed down to them from many generations,” she says. ', 'Sanchali now conducts workshops for women in Karnataka and trains them in making handcrafted and eco-friendly jewellery using the concept of re-cycling.', 'It was mainly started to fund our free school workshops but at the same time do so something that would add to the cause. So I started identifying those women who were interested in learning and working in a community. Sadly enough, we also came across some women who were not allowed to leave the house to work; so we took the work to their doorstep; we trained them at their homes and followed it up by collecting finished goods and making payments at the doorstep too.\n', 'Today, the project provides livelihood to many such women, “Our goal is to revive the dying tradition of re-cycling. At the same time we aspire to encourage art novices and connoisseurs to draw upon their proclivity for nature.”', 'Dakshayini has even created jewellery from waste material but her favourite jewellery collection happens to be the one which uses fabric scraps.', '“Our textile range uses wastes/leftovers from the tailors. We use a lot of old Indian Varanasi silk material and I try to preserve the textile, no matter how fragile it is,” she says, adding, “This collection is not only recyclable but is also a window to the beauty of the age old traditions.”', 'Sanchali’s products are now available at various stores in India and abroad. But this is just the beginning for Dakshayini’s dream is to bring jewels, education and beauty to the lives of many more. She continues to use education, traditional values & skills and recyclable material to bring beauty and light to one and all.', 'To know more drop by at dakshayinigowda.blogspot.com or write to Dakshyayini at sanchali[dot]in[at]gmail[dot]com', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

But even today, a large section of such physically handicapped people live in a hopeless state with no anticipation for betterment. Imagine someone who cannot walk and has no hope of even having the gift of walking on his own two feet. Polio Foundation has been relentlessly working for 25 years to bring in a ray of light in such darkened lives!', 'Since its birth in Ahmedabad in 1987, the foundation has been striving to fulfill its objective of aiding the physically handicapped children by way of corrective surgery and giving them necessary appliances so that they can walk on their feet without anybody’s assistance. This does not merely bring about physical gratification; it also has tremendous impact upon the psychological development of the child coupled with immense happiness to the family. The initial polio corrective operations of the foundation from 1987 to 1992 were limited to Sundays only. However, since March 1992, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has given special premises to Polio Foundation, a three-storied hospital in the heart of the city on a token rent of Rs. 1011 per year, where work is being carried on a daily basis. All treatments, care and calipers are provided without any cost to the patients.', 'The hospital offers a wide variety of services to the patients. Doctors, paramedics and donors have joined hands with each other for this noble cause. Right from prevention to rehabilitation, a single Window Service includes immunization, early diagnosis, counselling, corrective surgery, caliper workshop, socio- economic rehabilitation; each step towards definite freedom and happiness. There are various departments in the hospital, including Polio (OPD and Corrective surgery department), Cerebral Palsy, Paediatric Orthopaedic, Paediatric Plastic Surgery, Physiotherapy, Ophthalmology, Radiology, Prosthetic & Orthotic Department and Diabetic Foot Care.', 'The institute also has a training centre that offers various courses like Diploma in Rehabilitation Therapy, Bachelor of Occupational Therapy (BOT), Bachelor of Prosthetic & Orthotic (BPO), Bachelor of Audiology & Speech Language Pathology, Diploma in Special Education (Cerebral Palsy) (DSE-CP), Diploma in Medical Laboratory Technology (DMLT), Master of Social Work (MSW), etc.', 'Polio Foundation has also been awarded an ISO certificate that certifies that the quality management system of the foundation complies with the standards of ISO 9001:2008 for providing healthcare service to needy people.\nThe institute Indukaka Ipcowala Seva Sanshan has now opened for the benefit of the common man. Polio Foundation has introduced exclusive care centers for Diabetic Retinopathy and Diabetic Foot Care with skilled medico technocrats and well trained paramedical staff to render special investigation services through electronic and computerized medical equipments.', 'An example of a success story for the Polio Foundation is the case of Purvi from Dhanduka. At the age of seven years,\xa0while playing in the field, some particles went into her eye and the local village doctor mishandled her case miserably by pouring some wrong eye drops and she became blind. All her dreams for education and her parents’ wish to see their girl child educated and married shattered. A social worker came to know about Purvi’s condition while visiting their village. She straightway brought Purvi to Polio Foundation and took special interest to see that her Cornea grafting operation. The operation was fully successful and Purvi got her vision back.', 'Impressed by the outstanding performance of Polio Foundation, AUDA has allocated 5500 Sq. Yard land at Vejalpur, Ahmedabad for the Dream Project of creating a modern institute in the state of Gujarat. Work at the site has progressed at a furious pace at the site and the commencement of the institute is expected soon.\nThus, Polio Foundation is what they call a ‘conscious decision on the part of the medical fraternity, leading to absolutely free services for the less fortunate’. It is indeed a wondrous undertaking of the health community to focus on the utmost needy who just cannot afford the expensive services of modern hospitals and doctors.

5,2013-4,"['Archives', 'Kitchen Kinetics: Cooking Together In Shekhawati']","['It has been a long time since the popular 1980s soap, ‘Sanjha Chulha’, set in rural Punjab and best known for its moving title track sung by renowned Pakistani folk singer Reshma, went off air on Doordarshan. Even the wonderful tradition of village women gathering around a common oven to make rotis may have become a thing of the past in that state. But the ‘sanjha chulha’ (community kitchen) has been rekindled in the villages of the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan, albeit with a small modification. Keeping up with the changing times, instead of the earthen oven, it is the sanjha gas that the Shekhawati women are sharing today.', 'There are many advantages of a sanjha gas facility. It saves women the toil of lighting a wood fire several times a day; the consumption of fuel is less as is the environmental pollution. But what has made the return of community kitchen model really special is the fact that it is also providing a means of livelihood to the poor women of the community.', 'Sushila, a resident of Sangasi village in Jhunjhunu district, was living in abject poverty, barely managing to keep her household running. She couldn’t depend on her alcoholic husband for anything; he would even snatch away the meagre earnings she put together by doing menial jobs around the village. With no sustainable source of income and the responsibility of raising three children squarely on her shoulders, Sushila was always under great stress. Seeing no way out of her sufferings she had even contemplated suicide many times but continued struggling for the sake of her children. The end of her woes came with Sanjha Gas Scheme launched in 2007 by the M.R. Morarka-GDC Rural Research Foundation, a non-governmental organisation known for its pioneering work in the field of organic farming.', 'Under the Sanjha Gas Scheme, a group of four-five families comprising mostly Below Poverty Line (BPL) or landless labourers is given a gas connection and its accompanying accessories free of cost. The poorest woman from among them is made the group leader. The connection is given in the name of this leader, who not only has to pick up the cylinder from the city, but is also responsible for the maintenance and cleanliness of the facility. Each group member who uses it pays a small daily fee – cooking for four persons is priced at Rs 7, while it is Rs 10 for six members.', 'Sushila is the group leader of the Sanjha Gas Kitchen in her village. In addition to the income she gets from the sanjha kitchen, she now earns nearly Rs 2,500 per month (US$1=Rs 53) by supplying meals to students of a veterinary college in Jhunjhunu. She has regained her confidence, overcome her depression and is even managing to make a saving of Rs 100 per month as the member of a local Self Help Group (SHG).', 'When Savitri Devi of Jantawali village was widowed at the age of 25 she had nothing. Coming from a very poor and conservative family, she was living a secluded life after her husband’s death. Things, however, changed for the better ever since she got associated with the Sanjha Gas Scheme. At the initiative of Morarka Foundation, she even did a survey in her village on the relevance of such a scheme. It revealed that most women, especially those from poorer sections, were not even able to buy their monthly stock of wood at one go, let alone thinking of having a gas connection in their name.', 'The community kitchen has indeed been a boon. It has given local women relief from their tiny, smoky kitchens and saved them the monthly expenditure on fuel. Cooking is now an enjoyable activity even after a hard day’s work.', 'Mukesh Gupta, Executive Director of the Foundation, expands on the idea behind the project, “It is simply meant to bridge the gap between rural and urban households. Moreover, the fuel used in rural areas – whether it’s wood, cow dung cakes or coke in rare cases – is five times more expensive than LPG. This way, household money is saved along with the environment!” In fact, the Foundation has suggested to the state energy ministry to expedite the provision of an LPG pipeline supply to major cities across Rajasthan. Gupta believes pipeline service in the state capital of Jaipur alone can make available one lakh gas cylinders for the rural areas.', 'So far, there are 44 sanjha gas kitchen groups functional in the villages of Sikar and Jhunjhunu. “We want to add more groups but don’t get the gas connections so easily,” explains Vinod, the project officer, who routinely does surveys for the scheme and submits report for clearance. According to her, things could be much smoother if gas agencies were more cooperative. She adds that the agencies reportedly get a small two per cent subsidy on community kitchen gas subscriptions.', 'For Santara Devi of Jogia ka Bas village getting a gas connection was a luxury she could not afford. Thanks to this scheme, she too can avail of the facility. Says she, “Pehle barsaat ke mausam me gili lakdi ke mare phoonk marte-marte dam nikal jata tha. Aankh me pani aata so alag (Earlier, I used to have a tough timing cooking, especially during the monsoons when the fuelwood used to become damp).” Nowadays, making rotis has become so much faster and easier. In addition, Santara gets a monthly income too from the community kitchen as the other women in her group pay her a fixed amount for using the gas connection.', 'Kamlesh from Nirwana ki dhani, who comes to make rotis in Santara’s kitchen, reveals that one cylinder lasts for a month, and this makes it affordable. “It saves money, time, energy and, most importantly, the community gas kitchen has given us relief from our suffocating kitchens,” she says.', 'The sanjha gas kitchen is ideal for village women, who don’t have to make elaborate meals like their urban counterparts. Their fare is very simple – most group members make dal, kadhi or sabzi in their homes and use the community kitchen to make rotis. They bring the atta (wheat flour) dough from their home and make the rotis together. It also gives them an opportunity to meet and chat with each other. In fact, Vinod sees the sanjha gas system as an ideal community space.', 'More and more women are now showing an interest in getting a sanjha gas connection. Gupta believes that if the state government comes forward to promote these economically viable and eco-friendly community kitchens in rural areas, they would bring about a significant transformation in the lives of village women.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
6,2013-4,"['Archives', 'TBI Changemakers: Mr. Nand Lal Gupta – Five Decades of Incredible Innovations']","['It is not often that we come across serial innovators. And innovators who use locally sourced materials to create products that impact the lives of people in the region by providing means of livelihood and everywhere else by providing useful products at lower prices, are rare indeed. So meet Mr. Nand Lal Gupta whose innovations include adhesives made from cactus, boards made from pine needles and building blocks made of soil!\nDeep down in the Shivalik ranges of the Himalayas in Solan, Himachal Pradesh, a self-trained scientist, Mr Nand Lal Gupta, has been doing wonders for over five decades now. His high tech innovations in the field of adhesives, pine boards as wooden board substitutes and soil bricks have awed scientists working in various reputed institutions across the country. He is 85 years of age and is still standing tall with his gifted brain creating more and more scientific breakthroughs.', 'His latest innovation in the field of Pine Needles has raised hopes for more livelihood opportunities in Himalayan regions of the country. He has invented a methodology to make pine boards and pine wool by utilizing pine needles available in the forests. Various institutions such as Department of Forest, Himachal Pradesh have been trying to prepare pine boards for last four decades now. But all efforts, so far, have been in vain due to moisture problem in the final product. “I have finally solved the problem by developing a binder that removes moisture from the final product. My newly invented system gives 147 Kg/sq cm strength to pine boards that come at a cost that is 30% that of wooden boards available in the market”, explains Mr Nand Lal Gupta.', 'Mr Gupta’s journey started way back in 1948 when he joined Punjab University in Solan as a clerk. He was a matriculate, and his education could only provide him with two meals a day. He continued working with the university for the next ten years until it shifted to Chandigarh in 1958. His love for making scientific innovations out of locally available natural resources started in his later years of the job. Says Mr. Gupta:', 'After the University shifted, I was left with no means to earn my livelihood; still I sped up my research efforts and bought more and more books and patents to enhance my learning. Today, I have a huge library worth more than Rs 4 lakhs. There came times when I had to make my family skip meals in order to post enquiry letters overseas. The unparalleled support of my wife, Mrs Rukmani Devi, has been the backbone of my success throughout. From 1958 to 1970, I shifted from one occupation to another in order to support my family. I had to run a small Hosiery unit (1958-1964) and sell wooden boxes to breweries (1964-1970) while continuing with my research. Sometimes, I fell so short of finances that I had to borrow money from friends and well-wishers to follow my passion.', 'His previous innovations include 6 different types of adhesives made out of cactus in the late 60s. He was also awarded with the ‘National Award’ by Invention Promotion Board, New Delhi in 1972 for coming up with these adhesives, particularly “Cempromark” cement waterproofing compound and “Chunic” lime adhesive. Since 1972 till today, Government of Himachal Pradesh has been purchasing these adhesives from the factories owned by him. “Two of my sons are now running these factories to supply the adhesives to companies across the country. My work for utilizing cactus put me on the international radar, and I received appreciation from various countries. Government of Australia even invited me to settle in their country and solve the problem of widespread cactus over there. I, however, decided to stay in India and continue working from here only. I also became a member of VITA (Volunteers in Technical Assistance) Network based out of the US and received a lot of help and guidance from them in the last four decades.”', '“The journey, however, has not been easy so far as my low formal education background keeps me away from access to financial resources. In the last three years, I have been asking for financial support from various agencies to set up a laboratory in Solan for training people to make pine boards, but the efforts have not paid off till now. I have written numerous letters to heads of state and central government departments including Prime Minister Office and Indian National Congress. Very recently, District Administration of Solan and Vice Chancellor of YS Parmer University of Horticulture and Forestry, Himachal Pradesh have assured their help for enhancing the reach of my innovation”, narrates Mr Gupta with hope in his eyes.', 'On asking more about the kind of financial assistance he requires, Mr Gupta says that he does not prefer privatization of his innovation and would welcome any funding agency that would help him to make his innovation benefit local youth and empower them with livelihood opportunities. He plans to come up with a training-cum-research laboratory in Solan from where he can train local youth to manufacture pine boards. He has also started a small pilot to manufacture Pine Boards 40 Kms away from Solan in a town named Kunihar with the help of an old friend Mr Ram Swarup Tanwar.', 'Ram Swarup became a friend in 1968 when I came in touch with District Industry Office in Solan for my work in Pine Needles. He and the head of the department, Mr Ram Kumar Upmanyu, were nice to me for the work I was doing. They both understood the importance of the research as it could help prevent forest fires in entire Himalayan Ranges that occur because of highly-inflammable pine needles. Even today, Government of Himachal Pradesh spends crores of rupees every year to prevent such forest fires.', 'In the future, Mr Gupta plans to revolutionize housing and construction industry by coming up with bricks made of Soil. “I have so far achieved brick strength of around 91% as compare to that of cement plaster. My Soil bricks will cost 50% less as compared to regular bricks. I am currently in the process of improving my stabilizer to reach strength equal to that of cement plaster. I am expecting the final product by the end of this year”, adds Mr. Gupta.', 'We wish Mr. Nand Lal Gupta great success in his endeavours and hope his innovations have far-reaching impact.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
