Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.” – Margaret Mead', 'When I first heard of Swades, the words of Margaret Mead didn’t come to me right away. That’s because the cynical side of me (having been a journalist for nearly 15 years) was wondering what a group of college students could REALLY achieve in a world where inequity and inequality are rampant; where organisations crumble because at the core of their commitment to do good also lies the inability to understand what a huge commitment it really is.', 'So I did the next best thing. I joined their Facebook page and watched.', 'Although it has only been a few months, what I have seen and heard has raised a new hope in me. As a journalist, a mother and a citizen of this Nation I have always known that the real change in our society will come when our children learn the importance of contributing to the communities around them.', 'Swades, a registered NGO comprises a group of student volunteers from the Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) based in Vellore town, Tamil Nadu. Students from all over the country flock to this premier institute and Shubham Mittal was one of them.', 'Brought up in a family where contributing skills for the betterment of neighbouring communities was practised with aplomb (his great grandmother is 89 and still practises Ayurveda to help the ailing in her neighbourhood in Delhi), Shubham knew that he wanted to do something to “improve the lives of those around me”.', '“I wanted to contribute two hours of my day for a good cause..just two hours” says he. By this time (January 2014) he was also nearing the end of the fourth year of his B. Tech and was also pondering over his future – job, career etc. “A career in civil services was also playing on my mind when I realised that working for others would also be a kind of civil service,” he reminisces.', 'Soon he was convinced that he needed to do something for the town that welcomed the students of VIT and took them into their fold without resentment. Over cups of tea, he spoke to his peers and juniors who took his idea of ‘working for others’ with positivity and optimism.', 'A survey of the town was conducted to understand the needs of the hour, and by the time February had arrived, this group of students organised a dental camp at WHEEL Orphanage and Trinity School, Vellore where 250 children were examined and 120 found to need further treatment. Anchal Arora, core member of Swades, who at 21 is getting an “invaluable experience” says, “We are working on raising funds to have a treatment camp for the 120 children who need it.”', 'Since then this small but growing group of Swades members have created two major projects –Arogya and Kadam – and commenced Make A Wish initiative to help those in need.', 'Arogya is a project that focuses on Health, Sanitation and Hygiene. Says Shubham, “If we just look around us, squatting is still so common in rural areas and some urban areas too. This is not the India we want!”', 'Under this project, the first free dental camp was organised at the school and in March they conducted a complete health camp at the Tamil Association of the Blind. Swades has adopted the association and will continue to focus its efforts on improving the lives of these blind men and women, some of whom have spent their entire lives in isolation and deprivation.', 'In an effort to initiate the process of sustainability, the students also conducted a training session on healthy lifestyle and good habits (such as daily, twice brushing, washing mouth after a meal etc.) with the students of Little Flower School, Pallikonda, Tamil Nadu.', 'With Project Kadam, Swades ventured into the women empowerment issue. The project was launched on International Women’s Day (8th March, 2014) in Pallikonda Village, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where the women of the village were invited to gather. The purpose of the meeting was to initiate a dialogue to get the women residents to discuss the issues they face. It was heartening to see that not only women, but the men also came forward to express their concerns.Later they were encouraged to write down their desires and wishes, regardless of whether the wishes were related to them, their families or the village as a whole. With this, the Make A Wish initiative was also launched on the same day. As the name suggests, it encourages people to write down their wishes just like the residents of Pallikonda did. It will be Swades’ endeavour to fulfill the wishes of the lesser fortunate and at the same time allow those who ‘wish’ to help others achieve their dream as well.', 'Swades collaborates with local agencies in villages and schools to address the issues of the area. They connect volunteers to causes and help improve the lives of those in the community. Swades is also very clear that long term hand-holding of a community is an impossible task and an unachievable goal. Instead, they believe in empowering – through training and education, and want to create sustainable models of development in communities.', 'Swades is an initiative based NGO and believes that with the right push and the right aid, sustainability will allow the nation’s industrious majority to forge ahead on the path of a better life, and hence lead to their social, cultural, and personal development.', 'Swades has a core team of VIT students and a growing base of volunteers and paid members. “The reason why we had to formalise a structure and register an organisation is because we realised that no one was taking us seriously otherwise,” observes Shivani Agarwal, a third year student at VIT who is a core team member and was by her own admission, waiting for such an opportunity to come along.', 'To make volunteering a habit and to make it a process that is not viewed as burdensome, the Swades group called for volunteering for just one hour a day. Says Shubham, “One hour a day by twenty people is twenty volunteer hours. A lot can be done in 20 hours!”', 'Good initiatives also have the tendency to fizzle out when the stakeholders run out of steam, when careers take precedence or when the burden of their own lives becomes overpowering.', 'For Shubham, this was an issue that needed addressing because he didn’t want Swades to be a short-term endeavour or end up becoming a shot in the dark. To maintain a certain degree of sustainability as an organisation that will continue to uphold its ideals, Swades expects that the students who join as members will take their experience of grassroot volunteering (including initiating, organising and executing a project successfully from start to finish) to parts of the country where their jobs will eventually take them, where communities in need will be given the help they need. “The motive of Swades should always be foremost on your mind,” he emphasises.', 'According to him, the structure of the organisation has been planned in a way that succession from seniors to juniors will be a seamless process so that the good work never halts or takes a break. The students from all parts of India who join VIT will be exposed to the merits of volunteering with them.', 'While the goals of the organisation are lofty, it is also clear that the commitment and focus of these students, despite the pressure of academics on them, is not out of place. There is clarity in their thoughts and a determination in their balancing act.', 'Niharika Dharmani, daughter of a politician in Himachal Pradesh and a student of VIT sums it well when she says, “Swades has given us something worthwhile to do. We manage time well now and don’t waste our leisure hours roaming around with friends.”', 'And for bringing that kind of focus into the lives of a generation that is self-obsessed and selfie-obsessed I applaud Swades.

Initially the school charged Rs. 30/- as fees to cover only operational costs.\xa0A rickshaw-puller, an ayah and two teachers were the initial staff of the school.', 'Today, Deepalaya\xa0is considered as the largest operating NGO in Delhi.

In the school garden, one will find tapioca, banana, jackfruit and coconuts planted. There are separate bathrooms for boys and girls and water taps for each activity; to wash utensils, drink water and for bathroom purposes. The room where mid-day meals are prepared has a beautiful rangoli outside and upon entering the smell of fresh vegetables and sambar envelops you. The school walls are painted with numbers, days of the week, different currencies, hygiene and sanitation practices and more. There are six classrooms, each of which has more colorful depictions. Behind the classrooms is a little patch of land where children grow seasonal vegetables, which are used for the mid-day meal.', 'It’s hard to believe that four years ago, the school had just two rooms and about half acre barren land. And during rains, children wouldn’t be able to attend school due to lack of roads.', '“I used to play volleyball in the school premises and would pull out all the plants as we needed space. But today, I am the one who plants the most here”, said Bettanaik, member of SDMC (School Development Management Committee).', 'It’s 12:45 pm and the children are getting ready to eat their mid-day meals. As the teacher calls out each roll number, the corresponding child takes his or her plate and glass, washes them and sits, waiting for the rest to finish. “We don’t allow children to share each other’s plates and glasses keeping in mind best hygiene practices”, says a proud Eranayak, President of the SDMC.', 'Around 8 kms from here is the Beemanahalli Higher Primary School. The lunch hour has just finished and a group of children are playing on a see-saw pump. While swinging up and down, their energy pumps the underground water and lifts it to an overhead tank, where it is stored. “Everyday children play for half-hour. This ensures we have water stored at all times”, says Mahadev, the school’s headmaster who built this set-up with the help of the local community and SDMC.', 'In the Magudile Higher Primary School, which is a further 20 kms, every child deposits as less as Re 1 and this is noted in the child’s passbook. Says Shivanna T M, In-charge Headmaster, who motivated the school’s 113 children and has saved Rs 25, 000 so far:', 'The children use this money to buy school-related materials at a subsidized price. Every month, a SDMC member goes to Mysore and buys all things at wholesale prices. Also, if the family has any unforeseen medical circumstances, we give them their child’s savings.', 'The above initiatives indicate the vital role that can be played by the local communities, if they are organically linked to the schools. As people are made aware of their responsibilities and powers, they realize they can be change leaders and what we see is improved responsiveness and accountability in the delivery of overall education services. These people are part of the School Management Committees (SMCs), the formal functioning of which was institutionalized under the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009.', 'Constituted in every school, a School Management Committee (SMC) consists of 12-16 members of which parents form 75 percent and the remaining 25 percent consists of elected members of local authority; head-teacher, teachers and children of the school. 50 percent members of the committee shall be women. The constitution and functioning of SMCs has been institutionalized under the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009.', 'The SMCs are empowered with financial and decision making abilities which ensures high community participation and thus plays a prominent role in the overall governance of school education. Financially, SMCs have complete power over three grants – teacher learning material, school development grants and school maintenance grants, which constitute 6 percent of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) budget.', 'Every year there is 2 day training held in which two members of every school’s SMC are supposed to attend.

The proportion of schools that comply with RTE’s teacher-pupil ratio stands at mere 45.3 percent. Only 62.6 percent schools had a useable toilet.', 'The low indicators affirm the need for increased engagement; of the teachers, parents as well as the communities at large.', 'Nagaraj, Community Organizer, Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement (SVYM) believes:', 'Communities won’t become aware of their rights and powers by themselves. In most cases, teachers and headmasters don’t sensitize them to their democratic roles and responsibilities due to their own vested interests as, such participatory governance would take away their freedom. There are cases where SMC members are not even aware that they are members.', 'Earlier, we weren’t aware of our responsibilities and we had no voice to question the teachers. But after attending SVYM’s trainings, I come once a week to check the mid-day meal’s quality and taste. If the teacher has to take a leave, they have to take our prior approval.', 'Another parent immediately chimes in, “If we are aware of our rights, why won’t we exercise them? We all want a good education for our children.”', 'There is an immediate need for effective time-bound initiatives. Capacity-building, raising awareness on rights, provisions and accountability under RTE Act and mobilization of communities to undertake school monitoring are the needs of the hour. Furthermore, teachers and head-teachers also need to be sensitized on the advantages of decentralized administration in school.', 'It would be a good idea to engage with civil society organizations in order to build the capacities of SMCs. There have been various successful initiatives which reflect their capabilities to do the same. SVYM’s Shikshana Vahini is one such example wherein, from 2005-10, 7000 SMC members of 1566 schools in Karnataka’s Bijapur district were empowered. The impact of the training can be witnessed even today.', 'The entire committee now meets once a month and discusses a range of issues; performance of children, infrastructure needs, absenteeism, utilization of available resources, teacher regularity, teacher-pupil ratio etc; all of which ensure better planning and outcomes.', 'The Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD) needs to rapidly increase its training initiatives. In order to see real impact, trainings should be held at least twice a year wherein the second time, school development plans should be reviewed and grievances redressed. Also, at least 50 percent of the committee members must be trained, as against 2 from each school’s committee now.', 'Local communities have tremendous potential to transfix the existing educational system and this is possible through constructive dialogue and positive action. Teachers must work in tandem with SMCs and local communities for overall development.', 'says Swami, Headmaster, Government Higher Primary School, Nanjanayakahalli.

Millions were rendered homeless and many lost their lives. It’s been almost a year now and yet the process of rehabilitation and relocation of many is a question mark. Amidst this, here is an inspiring story of a young brave heart from Bankoli village in Uttarkashi district, one of the worst affected districts during the floods.', 'Mamta Rawat is 24 years old. Yet, she did not let her tender age confine her sheer strength of purpose, as she saved over a 1000 lives during the flash floods of Uttarakhand last June. While pilgrims were moving down to escape the fury of the floods from the upper reaches of Uttarkashi and Gangotri, Mamta was making her way up on her own to be part of the rescue effort. She had no official badge, no uniform, no map, no government order or logistical support. Her reason was simple “I am a resident of Uttarakashi and I have the skills required to help people. If I do not come forward at these times of trouble, who will?” she asks.', 'A trained mountaineer from the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, Mamta was in charge of a group of 30 school children from various parts of the country who had come to Dyara Top in Uttarkashi for an adventure outing. She was then working as a freelance instructor with INME, a Delhi based Adventure sport company that does children’s adventure camps. With floods ravaging, she, along with two other persons, took these kids to safety across landsides and a shaking bridge over river Aksai Ganga, personally taking each child on foot across the bridge which the raging water threatened to wash away.', 'After having got all the children back safely to Uttarkashi town she took care of the terrified children, all in the age group between 14-16 years, giving them courage and support. Once the route from Uttarakashi opened up towards Dehradun she made sure each child was safely surrendered to his/her parent and she immediately left to complete the unfinished work. This time around it was to help the pilgrims who were stranded and were traversing down to Uttarkashi from Gangotri, the roads having been washed away completely.', 'Mamta then joined the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering team and helped in the search and rescue operations. There are tales of this girl that will mesmerise people. While, on the rescue mission she carried a middle-aged pilgrim woman on her back as the lady was unconscious. She carried her on her back – like a mountaineer carries a rucksack – and ran down the rocky terrain for over 3km to help her get evacuated by a helicopter for further medical treatment. She was helping people during these troubled times even as her own house was washed away in the floods. Her house was part damaged in the 2012 floods and last year the remaining got completely washed away taking away the only roof over her family and her head. Today she lives with her family of 6 members under a tinned roof.', 'But, the simple-hearted girl lives her life as any other day. Even when asked by an Dehradun based NGO, Leap Foundation, what help she required with regard to her house she mentioned that it was nothing that she required but it’s her village that required rope/cable bridges to cross over the rivers, as all the old bridges were washed away by the river then.', 'Having dropped out of school to take care of her mother and her home, Mamta after a great struggle managed to do her Basic Mountaineering Course from the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, Uttarkashi. But, it took her two years after her Basic Course to save up another Rs 5000 to do her Advance Course. She did it with the hope that she could get employment in the adventure field. Having performed very well in the Advance course, she got a sponsor to fund her next course – the Method of Instruction course. She then went on to do her Search and Rescue Course. All these courses finally paid off and today she is a professional mountaineer and a qualified instructor.', 'Mamta, the only earning member of her family, is a determined young Gharwali girl who always puts others first and then thinks about herself. Unfortunately such is her plight that she has received no compensation from the Government only because she did not file her papers on time.', 'Summiting4Hope, a social initiative started by a mountaineer, came across Mamta while on relief operations in Uttarakashi and decided they would build a permanent shelter for her and her family. Summiting4Hope is currently raising funds for this and being supported in this effort by NIM principal Col Ajay Kothiyal and local architect Krishan Kuriyal, who has worked out the estimates and construction plan of the house.', 'For more details and to contribute check summiting4hope’s facebook page or send an email to subanusha@gmail.com', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

A 33-year old young entrepreneur, he truly believes that job satisfaction should be the priority and money eventually follows. An electronic engineer and an IIM graduate, Mukund was travelling with his uncle once when the idea of selling affordable computers struck his mind. That is when Renew It comes into picture.', 'Incorporated in 2009, Renew It started operations in 2010 with much research and hard work. “Initially I was the only one to do all the work including, marketing, managing finances, meeting clients, etc.,” Mukund says.', 'Renew It collects scrap computers from corporates and sells them at affordable rates to the needy people after the required repair and maintenance.', 'Started with a team of two which included Mukund and his cousin Raghav Boggaram as co-founders, Renew It has now grown to a team of seven technicians and sales persons.', 'The business model \xa0is very simple. We tie up with the corporates and take all their scrap computers. The team of technicians work on it to convert the scrap into a working machine. The process of buying the computers from these corporates is often a long procedure and can take as long as six months.', '“The system is not organized, people often tend to sell the scrap at per kg rates which is not a good idea in case of computers,” Mukund says.', 'After getting the scrap, the team of technicians start working on it and convert it into a working machine. The process takes around 2-3 weeks depending on the efforts required to fix the old machine.', 'The organization has sold 10,000 computers so far in a span of five years. “We were lucky that we had our family’s support so it wasn’t hard to arrange for finances,” Mukund says.', 'The biggest challenge or should I say fear is that I don’t know what will be the way forward, say, 5 years later as technology is completely evolving.', ' When he first started working on the idea of Renew IT, computers held an important place in the society as the smartphones weren’t there. “Now when I see people doing most of their work on their phones I don’t know how useful computers will be in future,” Mukund says.', 'Another challenge which Mukund faces is the unavailability of right type of scrap.

Think Again.']","['Read how Christel House India, a non-profit organization, is paving the way for a better India. The concept that took birth in Mexico is aiding several under-privileged and under-nourished children in their journey towards self-sustainability, helping them rise from the slums of Bangalore.', 'You give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. However, if you teach him how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. This is a saying that has been heard often, but how many times have you actually seen it being practiced? There’s an organization that has been actively involved in not just aiding, but helping underprivileged children support themselves for the present and future by providing free education, nutrition and primary healthcare. Right from imparting learning from KG through Grade 12 to supporting them in their career preparation and job placements, Christel House has been doing it all.', 'A socially conscientious businesswoman and philanthropist, Christel DeHaan was struck by the impoverished children from the two shelter homes that she visited in Mexico in January 1998. Donations of food or clothing could have seemed as possibly ‘helpful’ solutions but she realized these were merely temporary options. What these children needed was not sympathy or temporary fixtures that would make them more dependent. No, it was about fulfilling the long-run needs of the children, which were to help break their cycle of poverty and make them stand on their feet.', 'Christel wished to create a lasting difference by giving the poverty stricken children, the opportunity for transformational change. She sold her global vacation ownership exchange company Resort Condominiums International (RCI), of which she was the co-founder, in 1996 to fulfill this dream. She resolved to devote the next phase of her life to helping impoverished children. The foremost requirements for these were a holistic approach, quality staff, rigorous curriculum, measurement of results, and accountability on all fronts. This thinking led to the development of Christel House, and the first learning center opened its doors in Mexico in late 1998.', 'Thus began Christel House’s journey that travelled beyond the shores of Mexico with the mission ‘to care, to share, to make a difference’. Today Christel House International is assisting impoverished children in the United States, Venezuela, South Africa, Mexico, and India.', 'In fact, it was a quirk of fate and destiny that brought Christel House to India. The India wing of RCI had its main office in Bangalore. The significant economic differences among the people of the city, loomed large and visibly in front of Christel during her many visits to the Silicon City during the 1990s. Christel had been no alien to suffering caused by the paucity of resources. She had personally witnessed human misery due to poverty during World War II. The time was coming when some strong action had to be taken now instead of lamenting or feeling terrible. And Christel was all set to spearhead economic progress by mobilizing human resources available in any country. Her mission was to unleash latent energy and creativity and break the cycle of poverty.', 'Bangalore had been her first city of choice to begin her human capital development model of Christel House that ultimately began in Mexico. It was then in January 2001, when the India Learning Center of Christel House was set up in Bangalore.', 'The journey of a 5-year old child of a daily wage earner from a Bangalore slum, devoid of basic amenities, from learning and grooming himself, getting prepared psychologically, mentally and physically to finding jobs of repute in India and abroad, with a respectable income, does sound like a tale inspired from a Hindi film. But in reality, it’s the dream made true by Christel who envisaged a certain life for the neglected section and has made this happen for around 1300 students in India till date. A life change that has positively affected the families too. And a change that the poor families weren’t willing to embrace initially.', 'Yes, finding children and convincing their parents was one of the major challenges. Recalls Christel House MD \xa0Raju Shahani\xa0about the initial outreach efforts,', 'Visiting Bangalore slums especially those in the 20 kilometers radius of the school, was a key route to engaging parents and convincing them to send their children to Christel House. The prospect of education over child labor astnd additional family income wasn’t an easy discussion but the teams managed to get the parents commitment and continuity. Since then, neighborhood communities are engaged in school programs both by way of updates, counseling and participation to drive pride of association amongst them. We also interact and work with a few reputed local NGOs working in the community. NGOs that have a free hostel for the very poor and abandoned children are also allies.', 'Christel House had started off with 320 children in 2001.Today, while some of these children are engaged with private companies and earning a respectable living, others are pursuing courses in arts, commerce, medicine and engineering. Over 200 students have already graduated from Grade XII. They are enrolled in Christel House’s unique Work Study Program that assists them to join universities based on their academic interests and capabilities and also imparts vocational skills training options and job placements for students with economic compulsions. Christel House funds for University through the scholarship program.', 'Children who come to Christel House are largely from slums, shelters and low-income neighborhoods, belonging to non-migrant families settled in the city for more than 5 years. Orphans and single parent families receive extra preference for admissions. 10 buses are deployed daily from the Bangalore Metroploitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) to help children travel from over 18 slums within a 20 km radius to the school and back home safely.', 'On an average, for a family of 5 members that had a monthly income of a meager Rs. 6,500, where the wage earners were mainly employed in manual labour, it was no easy feat to ask the elders to let the young and potential extra earning hands to spend their days in acquiring education at a day school. And really, financial mess was not the only kind of ‘mess’ these children were living in.', 'The biggest challenge was to convince families from poor neighborhoods to educate their children rather than force them into child labor for supplementing family incomes. It was important that families supported the longitudinal model of Christel House and ensured that there were minimal or no dropouts for meaningful outcomes. Children came from beleaguered homes often with physical and emotional abuse. Learning disabilities, malnutrition and poor hygiene were some of the other issues that the team had to deal with.', 'Learning begins at a tender but impressionable age of 5 here. 70 children join KG every year at Christel House. Shahani explains:', 'We take children at age 5 in KG. We have 886 students in the current academic year. Christel House has classes starting from KG to Grade XII. The role of Christel House in the lives of its students does not however end with Grade XII. We continue to support them in career preparation and placement programs include career/vocational counseling, interview preparation, summer jobs opportunities, jobs placement assistance, etc.', 'Located on a seven acre site, the impressive infrastructure of the institute includes 29 classrooms, science laboratories, music room, library, junior and senior computer room, art room, resource room, sports ground, dining hall and kitchen, self-contained medical facility, laundry, shower rooms, a well-appointed staff room and an administrative block. A Board of Directors comprising of highly qualified professionals at Christel House, continuously review the progress made by the school and students on various parameters.', 'By selling off RCI that she co-owned, Christel provided the initial assistance to acquire the land for the school, while continuing to fund the general and administrative expenses. The rest of the project was kept running through donor contributions, fuelling the philosophy of ‘self transformation’ by the institute.', 'Now came the part where the children had to be prepared mentally, behaviorally, and physically. This had to be done constantly and gradually, to help them transition and adjust from the life in slums to be at par with the more privileged section in the cities and the world of jobs and opportunities.', 'A comprehensive behavioral counseling and support program was set up for the students as well as their parents under the guidance of various governmental/non-governmental agencies in Bangalore. Primary healthcare was provided with support from MS Ramaiah Hospital. A carefully designed nutrition program was put in place to provide three meals a day to the students at the school. Language skill development was another important initiative to ensure that students learnt the language of conducting business even outside Karnataka. Sports, Arts, Music, Leadership Lessons through Mentors were layered onto the academic curriculum. Domain experts were resourced from time to time for training and guiding students through various disciplines.', 'Today, the students are reaching far and wide, doing and achieving what they want to do with their heads held high. They are pursuing degrees in arts, commerce, software engineering, aeronautical engineering, medicine, hospitality, travel and so on. Thirteen of their students have found jobs in Dubai, with the TransGuard Group.

Sounds like a normal “old Indian saga”? Not really! The girl later on became the first Indian woman to qualify as a doctor. Even though she died at a very young age of 21, she opened the gates for many young women in India who wanted to do much more than devoting their entire life to household chores. Yes, we are talking about Anandi Gopal Joshi, India’s first lady to qualify as a doctor from the USA in 1886.', 'You go to a hospital and a lady doctor is there to attend to you. Doesn’t look like an unusual scenario, right? But back then in the nineteenth century, it was nothing less than a miracle. Even today, India is struggling with a major dearth of doctors, especially female doctors. At present, nearly 66 percent of the health workers are men. Only 17% of all allopathic doctors and 6% of allopathic doctors in rural areas are women. According to the paper “Human resources for health in India”, published in the British Medical Journal ‘Lancet’, 1 in 5 dentists are women while the number stands at 1 in 10 pharmacists. (Source)', 'If this is the condition in the current scenario, where we believe India is progressing rapidly and women are getting equal opportunities, just imagine what would have been the condition at the time when Joshi dared to go out of her way to pursue medicine.', 'We all hear about how people fight against the masses and make their mark. In the glory and the success we often fail to recall the efforts of other people who made it possible for them. Every superhero has his army of helpers and we have this army in real life too in the form of family, friends, mentors etc.', 'Gopalrao Joshi, Anandi’s liberal husband is one such person who stood by his wife’s side and acted as her biggest inspiration and push. Gopalrao, a postal clerk, was determined to educate his wife when she expressed her wish to study medicine at the age of 14, after losing their first child just 10 days after delivery because of unavailability of proper medical resources.', 'At a time when women’s education wasn’t taken seriously, Gopalrao appeared as a great exception. He had married Anandi on the condition that he should be permitted to educate the girl and that she should be willing to read and write.', 'Gopalrao started teaching Anandi how to read and write Marathi, English and Sanskrit. He also transferred himself to Calcutta to avoid direct interference of Anandi’s parents in her education.', 'Gopalrao was an obsessed man. One day, when she was found helping her grandmother in the kitchen, Gopalrao flew into an uncontrollable rage and beat the young girl with a bamboo stick. The neighbourhood was agog: husbands beat wives for not cooking — but whoever had heard of a wife being beaten for cooking when she should have been reading. (source)', 'Anandi gradually turned into a well-read intellectual girl. All this change took place in the face of stiff opposition from her parents, frequent bickering in the family and the stubborn attitude of her husband. (Source)', 'In 1880, he sent a letter to a well-known American missionary, Royal Wilder, stating his wife’s keenness to study medicine in America and if he would be able to help them. Wilder agreed to help the couple on the condition that they convert to Christianity.\xa0This proposition was not accepted by the Joshis.', 'Wilder extended his help by writing about it in a local paper, and Theodicia Carpenter, a rich American from New Jersey, saw the articles, and offered to help Anandi as she was impressed by the earnestness and keenness of Anandi to study medicine.', 'In the meanwhile, Anandi’s health was constantly declining. She suffered from weakness, constant headaches, occasional fever, and, sometimes, breathlessness. Initially reluctant to go abroad due to her bad health, Anandi eventually agreed after much persuasion from her husband and started studying medicine in Women’s Medical College of Pennsylvania (now known as Drexel University College of Medicine) at the age of 19 and got her M.D. degree in 1886. On her graduation, Queen Victoria sent her a congratulatory message. She completed her thesis on obstetric practices among the ancient Hindus.', 'Anandi’s extract from her letter of application to WMCP says,', '“[The] determination which has brought me to your country against the combined opposition of my friends and caste ought to go a long way towards helping me to carry out the purpose for which I came, i.e. is to render to my poor suffering country women the true medical aid they so sadly stand in need of and which they would rather die than accept at the hands of a male physician. The voice of humanity is with me and I must not fail. My soul is moved to help the many who cannot help themselves,” (Source)', 'Anandi was already ill with the first symptoms of the tuberculosis that would ultimately kill her. Her health worsened when she returned to India in 1886. She received a grand welcome and The princely state of Kolhapur appointed her as the physician-in-charge of the female ward of the local Albert Edward Hospital.', 'Anandi received a letter from Lokamanya Tilak, Editor “Kesari”, saying, inter alia,', '“I know how in the face of all the difficulties you went to a foreign country and acquired knowledge with such diligence. You are one of the greatest women of our modern era. It came to my knowledge that you need money desperately. I am a newspaper editor. I do not have a large income. Even then I wish to give you one hundred rupees.”', 'Anandi died a few days after it. She passed away on 26th February 1887, a month before turning 22. Her ashes were sent to Mrs. Carpenter, her host in America who placed them in her family cemetery near New York.', 'Caroline Wells Healey Dall wrote Anandibai’s biography in 1888. Doordarshan aired a Hindi serial named “Anandi Gopal” based on Anandibai’s life. (Kamlakar Sarang directed the serial.) Shrikrishna Janardan Joshi wrote a fictionalized account of Anandabai ‘s life in his Marathi novel Anandi Gopal. (The novel has been translated in an abridged form in English by Asha Damle.) It has also been adapted into a play of the same name by Ram G. Joglekar.', 'Institute for Research and Documentation in Social Sciences (IRDS), a Non-governmental organization from Lucknow has been awarding the Anandibai Joshi award for Medicine in reverence to her early contributions to the cause of Medical sciences in India.', 'In a time when a women’s position was not even considered in the society and their education was unthinkable, Anandi took a bold step to fight and go against the flow to become a doctor. This was possible because of a big supporting hand from her husband Gopalrao who never let her quit and always inspired her to do more.', 'When some parts of India still deal with unsupportive husbands and a society that thinks a woman’s place is inside the house, the story of the couple is a fresh change. We don’t know if Gopalrao was too harsh on his wife and whether his obsession was justified. All we can say is his support for women’s education and their empowerment was remarkable for the time he lived in.', 'Though she could not convert her degree into a successful profession due to her untimely death, Anandibai surely left a mark on India’s heart and contributed to a much better, and bolder, India.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Even without any formal training, they have learned to fix bones using steel wires, stitch wounds using absorbable thread, perform complicated surgeries and even prescribe medicines simply by observing veterinarians over the years.', 'Funds are a major concern for the brothers as their business is dying and their professional lives are coming to an end because of their involvement with conservation. It has been more than a decade, but still, 95% of the expenses in their rescue efforts go out of their own pockets.', 'With our experience, we discovered that veterinarians did not have the required knowledge on birds, so we did not have anyone to go to and look up for help. Either we had to perform surgeries on the wounded bird ourselves or watch it die. This made us experts in avian orthopedic surgery.', 'Interestingly, without being veterinarians professionally, they have managed to learn how to treat the birds through books and consulting doctors.
