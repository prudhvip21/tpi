We aim to showcase some of these innovations here as part of an ongoing series called ‘Grassroots Innovation’.', 'This article is about an interesting innovation called the “multi-utility fuel efficient stove”.', 'A stove is still the most widely used device for cooking in large parts of rural and semi-urban India. This domestic product has huge social signifance. However, it is also a reason why a majority of rural women have breathing-related disorders due to inefficient burning of kerosene. These stoves also lead to huge loss of fuel.', 'This is where Mr. S. C.

1,2011-2,"['Archives', 'Renu’s Zoo Story: Solar Power Keeps Animals Comfy']","['\n\n\nby\n\nAnjali Singh\n\n\nFebruary 25, 2011, 8:05 am \n\n\n', 'Lucknow (Women’s Feature Service)\nLucknow’s Prince of Wales Zoological Garden has earned the unique distinction of becoming the first zoo in the country to use solar energy. Presently, all the zoo offices, the streetlights and the kitchen run on solar power. Another six months and the entire establishment will switch to this eco-friendly fuel – including the water pumps, the animal hospitals, the water heating systems, the nursery, the water power ejectors that run the fountain, the vehicles that ferry visitors within the zoo, the ticket house and even the quaint lanterns that decorate the main gate! Moreover, the irrigation system at the bio-fuel plantation in the zoo nursery will also run on sunlight.', 'The driving force behind this path breaking change is Zoo Director Renu Singh, who has ensured that anything and everything that can use this renewable energy source is made compatible with solar-energy.\n', 'But what inspired the thirty-something Singh to turn the zoo into a green zone? It all began in 2008, when during a meeting at the Uttar Pradesh (UP) Chief Secretary’s office, it was decided that a solar energy park would be constructed on dedicated land within the Lucknow zoo. The park was to be used to educate people about the benefits of solar energy. “I was not convinced that just setting up the park would motivate people to switch to solar energy. So I started to look for ways by which this idea could be made more people- and zoo-friendly,” says Singh. That’s when she hit upon the idea of using solar energy to power the zoo’s existing infrastructure.', '“It was a workable idea and what really excited me was that we could cut down on the huge electricity bills, which amounted to Rs 7,84,000 (US$1=Rs 46.9) every year. Moreover, instead of creating a solar energy park within the zoo, the entire Lucknow zoo will now set an example of how functional use of solar energy is possible in our day-to-day work. It will also educate organisations and visitors on how alternate sources of energy can be made useful for them as well,” explains Singh. Her efforts have been able to bring about a sea change in the way things are run in the zoo.', 'The project of turning Lucknow’s largest green lung into a truly eco-friendly zone was funded by New and Renewable Energy Development Agency (NEDA) of the UP government. The total cost of this transformation is estimated at Rs 94,34,000. “NEDA will put up all the solar panels and get the whole setup functional. From there on we will be responsible for its maintenance and we are more than prepared for the task,” says Singh.\n', 'This green initiative will go a long way in bringing about a healthy environment for the animals. “Clean, healthy and animal-friendly surroundings will provide a congenial environment for our inmates, which will also encourage breeding. In addition, solar powered battery-run cars and three wheelers will ply within the zoo for senior citizens and children. This will not only facilitate their movement within the premises but will also help curb air and sound pollution.\nIt will encourage the development of a micro-climate that will help change the environment of the zoo for the better,” explains Singh. However, she is quick to add, “The process will not happen right away. When a congenial atmosphere is provided, change will happen but it will be gradual one.”', 'Singh is not the only one who is upbeat about the changes taking place at the zoo. Her staff is completely involved in the project, too. Sameer Kumar, Assistant Accountant, Lucknow Zoo, says, “The initiative by NEDA at the Zoo, which director saheb has implemented is a very positive step as it will make the zoo a no pollution zone and cut electricity costs substantially. This way, the additional funds being saved can be used for bringing in other facilities at the zoo. All the employees here welcome such moves.”', 'Singh aims to sensitise all the people and not only the staff. “Had I gone ahead with the plans to set up just a solar energy park then only those responsible for the park would have been sensitised towards conservation efforts and eco-friendly energy sources. Now everyone will be using solar energy and will get used to the idea quite naturally,” she reasons optimistically.', 'And does Singh, who has a nine-year-old daughter, feel that being a woman has helped her put this innovative idea into practice? She answers with a smile, “I don’t know if being a woman has helped achieve all this but I can confidently say that as women we are very focused and if we believe in something we go for it with single-minded devotion.”', 'Singh is also proud of the growing profile of the zoo. “When I joined as a director in 2007, the zoo got a fund of Rs 37,50,000. The government increased the cash flow to Rs 70,00,000 last year. So I guess something right is happening. In addition to that we have generated around Rs 30,00,000 through animal adoption schemes at the zoo in 2008-09,” she says.', 'In fact, recently Singh added a famous name to her animal adoption list – Hindi film actress, Dia Mirza, who called Singh a “rock star” when she recently visited the Lucknow zoo at Singh’s request to adopt two leopard cubs.', '“There is an interesting story behind my move to invite Mirza to the zoo,” elaborates Singh. “A female leopard named Dia came to our zoo from Mirzapur. I put the two names together and called her Dia Mirza. When she had her cubs I decided to inform the actress with whom she shared her name and motivated her to adopt the twin cubs. And Mirza agreed to do so and named the cubs, Ashoka and Nakshatra. She also donated Rs 1,00,000 for their upkeep.”', 'The salwar kameez and walking shoes clad Singh is an inspiration to many, including her own husband, Amitabh Yash, the Superintendent of Police of Sitapur. He says, “I have followed a lot of work she has done for environment. It was under her influence that I took serious action against illegal tree felling and poachers here in UP. She is very thorough when she works on eco-projects and does complete research before she launches it. And even though she is dedicated to her job she is committed to our home too. That’s what keeps a perfect balance in our lives. To me she is a complete woman.”', 'Even the environment lobby is very happy with Singh. Environmentalist Prabha Chaturvedi feels, “Such initiatives are a much needed role model. The zoo being the oldest green confine in Lucknow is an apt place to start such eco projcets, as it represents the environment that we are polluting senselessly. Using solar energy has been a challenging proposition but what I hear is that the model at the zoo is a worakble one so I am looking forward to its launch.”', 'A zealous crusader, Singh has many more plans for the zoo. She is all set to see the completion of her next big project – a fully functional a state-level hospital at the zoo. Constructed at the cost of Rs 147.94 lakh, the medical facility will have X-ray machines, ultrasound facility, 14 indoor wards, A rescue room, ambulances, incubators and two full-time doctors on duty round the clock. And, of course, the hospital too will be solar powered.', 'Singh’s zoo story is sure to be a trendsetter for other zoos across the country and inspire those who want to make a difference to the environment.', 'This article has been written by Anjali Singh for Women’s Feature Service (WFS) and has been published here based on an arrangement with WFS.

The good news is we still haven’t gone too far ahead in the wrong direction. There are plenty of people working at the grassroots and recouping India’s nearly lost glory.', 'One of them is the Happy Hands Foundation. True to its name, the organisation strives to revive the cultural traditions, art and craft forms through contemporary ways and initiatives such Green Room and Blue-Prints.', 'In a country where over 200 crafts are endangered today, this NGO has already impacted the lives of 500 artisan families, allowing them an income base from craft-work. What has been the impact? Indian craftsmen are increasingly making it to the limelight for their unique works. “Our artisans, like Om Prakash from Rajasthan are finally getting the recognition. Om Prakash, a potter, recently entered the Limca Book of Records 2011 for making the tallest terracotta Coke bottle. Our Orissa artist now has HCL on his customer list.

Chances are, you will think of green paddy fields, a bullock cart tottering along dusty pathways, womenfolk carrying a load of firewood and mud houses emitting sooty smoke from their hay-stacked rooftops. From a distance, it is an unhurried, calm and stress-free life; even romantic!', 'Now imagine being in the place of that woman; who gets up before sunrise, walks to the nearest bushland or harvested fields, collecting as much dry wood as she can carry on her head and walks back to her hut to begin cooking for the day. Her luckier cattle-owning neighbor uses dried dung cakes instead. As she stokes fire in a rudimentary stove, a thick blue blanket of smoke takes her in its embrace. And soon, the lungs harshly begin to expel air, eyes start watering, while she unmindfully continues about her daily chores.', 'I ask her, “Doesn’t this smoke make you sick?” She says, “Why, this is how my mother and my grandmother have always cooked. They were quite alright!” Logic you can’t argue with, especially with people whose immediate worry is about ensuring at least two meals a day instead of health concerns.\n“Have you tried getting an LPG cylinder?”\n“Gas would be good to have, but it costs Rs 375 a month. We can’t afford that. We use kerosene sometimes, but that too has to be bought from the black market, as the ration shop is always out of stock. ”', 'Given the rising costs of LPG and the challenges of distribution in the interior of our country, over 75 million households in the country either have no access to clean energy, or cannot afford it. As a result, they still depend on traditional sources of cooking energy like firewood or agricultural residues on the traditional chulha. Not only does it create indoor air pollution, it is also inefficient in energy conversion.', 'Over the years, the government has launched several initiatives like the Improved Chulha Programme to address indoor air pollution and improving efficiency of stoves. But, even with the best of intentions, most of these have not made much headway.', 'First Energy, a Pune-based start-up in the alternative energy space, was setup to offer a clean, affordable and accessible cooking solution to the under-served. While doing so, it is also attempting to create a sustainable business model – a welcome departure from the half-hearted CSR or aided initiatives which quickly lose steam and thus, their purpose.', 'First Energy worked with Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore to create Oorja biomass fuel and stove which together provide an almost smokeless cooking solution that’s much more efficient compared to the traditional stove, and more affordable than LPG.', 'Oorja fuel is made out of agricultural waste like bagasse, groundnut husk or cotton stalks. It is compressed into high density pellets and sold in five, ten or fifteen kilogram bags. Oorja stove burns these pellets more efficiently using innovative gasification process. Mahesh Yagnaraman, MD of First Energy says, “Our stove is a prime example of how products can be co-created with the consumer, rather than just selling them ‘hand-me-downs’. The offering, from the start has been tailor made keeping the lifestyle of these households in mind. We made a lot of changes to greater safety, ease of use, and durability.”', 'There was a great product which consumers were willing to buy. How does one go about selling, though? Reaching these far flung villages has been a challenge for even the FMCG multinationals. Given the profile of these consumers, margins are lower. And that’s why, costs of raw materials, production and distribution of stove and pellets have to really tightly controlled.\n“Oorja is essentially a product for the woman of the house. We set about creating a network of prominent women in the villages who had some influence over large communities. They were our village level entrepreneurs. They would go from door-to-door, giving demos and convincing other women to buy. That really worked”, reveals Mukund Deogankar, Operations Director at First Energy.', 'Because its fuel is easily available in the neighborhood, Oorja is eliminating the need to collect and store firewood. For households who still aspire to own the LPG stove, it has given them an affordable alternative. Along the way, Oorja is also helping to reduce black carbon emissions.', 'The company has also launched new versions of Oorja for small hotel/dhaba or tea stall owners helping them save on commercial LPG costs.', 'Today, First Energy has over 4,75,000 consumers using Oorja stove and fuel across thousands of villages and urban poor in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. That’s the number of women who now breathe, cook and live easier. Amidst the white noise on climate-change, depleting natural resources, and energy security, it’s easy to miss the woods for the trees. And even easier to pin the big blame (quite often, with great reason) on profit-making corporate entities. However, the idea that we can do anything to create a planet-friendly and yet sustainable model without the participation of private initiatives making a business out of it would be overly optimistic, if not entirely unfounded. Initiatives like that of First Energy, thus need to be supported.', 'To know more about First Energy, visit www.firstenergy.in', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

So a male colleague got the chance,” says Bal, adding, “It was accepted that I was competent and totally up to doing the job, but in some situations, a woman is perceived as a risk by the powers that be.”', 'Bal’s research is on HIV/AIDS amongst sex workers, migrant workers, injecting drug users and street children. “Science is not as sterile as it’s perceived to be. For example, I don’t just focus on things like how sharing of syringes can spread HIV, but also study in depth the behaviour of street children who take drugs,” she says.', 'Bal, who has been working as a research scientist for over eight years at the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED), Kolkata, says being a women has never come in the way of her career, except for some minor security concerns.', 'It is increasingly becoming apparent that women scientists are finally making their mark in a hitherto male-dominated field. The prestigious Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, 2010, had nine awardees, of which three were women. Considering that in the 52-year history of these awards only 14 women have won this coveted prize out of 463 scientists, this year’s list clearly indicates that women scientists are now capturing greater recognition for their work.', 'Interestingly, it’s young women who are making waves with their outstanding research – the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, instituted by the Council of Science and Industrial Research (CSIR), is given to scientists below the age of 45. Although the award is normally given in seven disciplines, this year, outstanding work could be identified only in five – Biological Science, Engineering Science, Chemical Science, Medical Science and Physical Science.', 'Computer scientist Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay, a Professor at Kolkata’s Indian Statistical Institute, was one of the three women who got the award this year.', '“I give full credit to my parents. They motivated me constantly so that I could devote myself to seeking out the molecular mechanisms that underlie cancer, which got me this top science prize,” says the 42-year-old scientist, who uses computer science methods to locate and analyse the functions of micro-RNAs, a group of molecules responsible for causing several diseases, including cancer.', 'Professor Bandopadhyay says her husband, Professor Ujjal Moulik, who teaches computer science at Jadavpur  University, has been her inspiration and support, helping her to balance home and lab simultaneously. “Recognition in science doesn’t come quickly. It takes years of hard work and total commitment before accolades come your way. It’s tough for women to continue scientific research for a long time, mostly because of social and family commitments. But just because the number of women in this field is less than satisfactory, there is no reason to think that there is injustice or discrimination against women in the scientific world,” she says.', 'The mindset of the family and the social circle the women grow up considerably affects their career choices, Professor Bandhopadhyay points out, adding, “From childhood, girls are often pointed towards things like marriage and caring for the family. They are hardly encouraged to take an interest in science and engineering. If they fear Mathematics or Physics, it’s accepted as normal for girls. No effort is made to eradicate the source of that apprehension. In fact, they are often brain-washed into believing that science is not a girl’s cup of tea!”', 'The mother of a 10-year-old adds, “I think the focus has to start from school days. The women have to rise above preconceived notions and not fall prey to regressive indoctrination. They work hard to look after their children, that same hard work they can put into science too. That’s what I always tell my students. Being a woman, I did not face any problems. There was no advantage either. I had to work just like my male colleagues.”', 'The award to three women scientists this year has encouraged several young girls. “I received many phone calls after getting the award. Even students whom I do not know called me. That is really very encouraging,” says the brilliant scientist who does not practice any religion but feels inspired by the philosophy of Swami Vivekananda and Ram Krishna Paramahansa.', 'So do scientists need to have extra grey matter? “Scientists always think innovatively. They try to find new things, so their brains always have to be active. Scientists think constantly. Maybe that’s what marks them out from other people,” says Professor Bandopadhyay, whose favourite pastime is to relax on the banks of the Ganges at Belur Math, close to her home.', '“If someone asks me to sing a song, I will be an absolute failure. It all depends on individual ability and I don’t think I have an extraordinary brain just because I am a scientist,” says Dr Reshmi Pal, 33, MBBS and Master in Public Health. Pal is researching into arsenic related diseases, cervical cancer and Malaria at NICED. “The threat of cervical and breast cancer is a burning issue in India. These are the commonest diseases among women. Few know that the Human Pappiloma Virus (HPV) – that triggers cervical cancer – is sexually transmitted from men to women. The death rate is high but if proper steps are taken it can be prevented. My study is largely focused on these issues, besides arsenic poisoning and malaria, two major problems in eastern India,” she says.', 'So why are scientists often stereotyped as being eccentric or socially inept? Dr Dipika Sur, 56, MBBS, MD, who is one of the leading scientists handling the Clinical Trial of India’s indigenous Cholera Vaccine ‘Shanchol’ under NICED, says, “We use our brains in our fields but that doesn’t mean people in other fields have less intelligence. It also does not mean that we would be inept in a social situation or in handling family commitments. Look at my work for example. The entire project is aimed towards the benefit of the poor, who are the biggest sufferers of cholera. The trial is being conducted on a 1,10,000 population in Beleghata area of Kolkata, whose confidence and trust required to be won before the trial could start. Social ineptness would not have made it possible,” points out the eminently successful field scientist.', 'Dr Sur also champions the success of women scientists. “It’s true that earlier their male counterparts dominated the scientific community but one has to take into account the fact that men have been in the field longer. Women entered later, but are now definitely rising above the norm.”', 'Referring to the three women scientists who got the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar award Dr Sur observes, “Their success has encouraged women scientists tremendously. I always feel proud when women achieve something.”', 'Science is often perceived as a dry, sanitised, black-and-white sort of field, where emotion and humour have little role to play.

8,2011-2,"['Written by Unnati Narang', 'Sadguru Foundation: Providing Economic Freedom to Tribals']","['\n\n\nby\n\nUnnati Narang\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2011, 2:12 pm \n\n\n', 'India’s Census 2001 classified 84.33 million persons as members of Scheduled Tribes. With almost 10% of our population as belonging to tribal groups, their interests must be matched with national and economic interests of India as a whole. Since time immemorial, tribals have been victims of abject poverty, with their livelihood depending solely on agriculture and allied activities. About 66.84% of India’s tribal population is engaged in agriculture. With most such families relying on natural resources for their livelihood, any threat to the environment has the potential of destabilising their lives too.', 'Recognizing a concern for natural resources and their importance in preserving the lives of India’s indigenous peoples, Navinchandra Mafatlal Sadguru Water Development Foundation was established as a non-governmental organization in 1974. The foundation nurtured a vision of helping tribal people break away from their circles of poverty and unemployment, so as to include them in the mainstream economic activity of India. The approach used was to restore lost natural resources. Their website notes, “Not so long ago, Dahod situated in Western India was covered with thick dense forests –\xa0a home for wild tigers and elephants. The tribals of the region earned their livelihood from the forests. For the last fifty years there has been immense natural resource destruction and inappropriate management leading to loss of biological diversity. The organization Sadguru Water Development Foundation, an NGO, established in 1974, dedicated itself to the betterment of rural and tribal people by helping them make better use of available resources, appropriate technology and participatory managerial practices.”', 'They have many programmes centred on the environment such as ‘community water resource development’, ‘participatory micro watershed development’ and ‘environment and forestry’.', 'Often, a single small step can lead to beginnings of a great revolution. Similar was the journey of Sadguru foundation. Mr. Harnath Jagawat, Trustee and Director, N.M. Sadguru Water and Development Foundation, who has been working in the field of\xa0 rural development and tribal development for last 38 years, writes, “For first two years, it was one person with one in all functions, combining Chief Executive, typist, clerk, driver, peon, everything. Till we reached the staff strength of four, we had only one table shared by four persons sitting on four sides of a common table, placed in one room office of 10 X 15 feet area. Purchasing a simple cheap chair of Rs. 20/- would require lot of thinking and readjusting the budget as it was paltry sum of about Rs. 25,000/- per year which was available from Mafatlals to that all-in-one functionary.”', 'How then, did the organisation reach where it is today? He explains, “1990 was an important turning point with the substantial foreign funds matched by the Government funds paved a way for scaling up of the activities. The scaling up was very successful. With this success, which also proved our enhanced capability, more funds were mobilised from the foreign funding agencies. Our tough and rough infancy period full of turmoil, made us tougher to accept any challenge and it also taught us that when the opportunity was offered, it had to be grabbed. What was once started, as an insignificant, modest experiment has been now acknowledged as a viable, relevant and replicable important model in the tribal development, with a prospect to spread in the entire tribal region of our country.”', 'The impact of such a movement is clear from its achievements in the past one year. 42,71,626 saplings have been planted within one year, under the agro forestry and horticulture species, the highest ever plantation by the organization since they started this activity from the year 1982. 33 hamlet-cum-house hold based drinking water systems have been established. First time in the backward district of Dahod, the tribal households could get house hold drinking water connections with almost 24 hours water supply. While in the cities, we tend to take such bare minimum necessities of life for granted, those who have the courage and the motivation to reach out to areas devoid of such facilities deserve noteworthy credit.', 'Visit http://www.nmsadguru.org/index.html to read more about their work.\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', ""Co-Founder of Serene Woods portal for authors and photographers, I have authored two books - 'Drenched Soul' (poetry) and 'If At All' (fiction).

9,2011-2,"['Written by Rahul Anand', 'Hole in the Wall (HiWEL) – Spreading Computer Literacy']","['“Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come” – This is precisely the thought which has taken shape in the form of HiWEL. ‘Hole in the Wall’ offers a refreshingly fresh perspective on the learning process. Today’s children not only need basic education but also the ability to learn from their surroundings and adapt themselves to the rapidly changing paradigms. Dr. Sugata Mitra, Chief scientist at NIIT had been toying with the idea of unsupervised learning and computers. On 26th January, 1999, Dr. Mitra’s team carved a “hole” in the wall that separated the NIIT premises from the adjoining slum in Kalkaji, New Delhi. Through this hole, a freely accessible computer was put to use.\xa0 This computer proved to be an instant hit among the slum dwellers, especially children.', 'Since its inception in 1999, Hole-in-the-Wall has grown from a single computer at Kalkaji to more than a hundred computers at various locations across India and abroad. The driving force behind this is the concept of Minimally Invasive Education proposed by Dr. Mitra.', 'These slum children could actually learn on their own that too in such a cost effective manner with benefits like improved group dynamics, better in-class behaviour.', 'Playground Setting: The learning station is set up in an outdoor playground setting which children can easily access at any time. It ensures that girls, who would generally not be sent to close rooms housing a computer can now easily access the computer in an open setting.', 'Another advantage is the Unstructured and Unsupervised nature of this setting which ensures that the entire process of learning is driven by a child’s curiosity.', 'Integration with the School System: A big advantage of HiWEL learning station is that it fits in nicely with traditional schooling reinforcing learning in a fresh, innovative package.', 'In schools where the Learning Stations were installed, some teachers have reported improved retention and increased receptivity among children.', 'HiWEL’s endeavour is to make the learning stations accessible even in the remotest locations. For this, the HiWEL team has come up with several patented innovations to ensure that a standard computer can be used in extreme weather conditions. Till now Learning stations have been successfully deployed even in Leh (ladakh) and Jaisalmer.', 'Hole-in-the-Wall Education Ltd.(HiWEL)\xa0 is a joint venture between NIIT Ltd. and the International Finance Corporation. The Government of Delhi first adopted the idea and in 2000, 30 Learning Stations were setup in a resettlement colony.', 'In 2001, a national research program was started in which Learning stations were set up in 23 locations across rural India. By 2004, HiWEL reached Cambodia and the idea hasn’t stopped spreading.', 'Just recently HiWEL was conferred the coveted ‘Digital Opportunity Award’ by World Information Technology and Services Alliance (WITSA) for path breaking work in spreading computer literacy at the grass root level.', 'HiWEL is now poised to scale up the idea of Hole-in-the-Wall to make a significant contribution to improving elementary education and \xa0life skills of children across the world, especially those in disadvantaged communities in rural areas and urban slums.', 'All images are courtesy www.hole-in-the-wall.com\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Writer, Researcher interested in social enterprise, innovation, culture and networks.
