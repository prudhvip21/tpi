AVAZ provides a ‘voice’ to a non-verbal child with Cerebral Palsy, allowing him/her to communicate with friends, family and teachers. By enabling speech-impaired children to communicate easily, this device is helping them become much more independent and free from their existing barriers. ', 'Cerebral palsy (CP) is a congenital condition in which the motor cortex of the brain is damaged. People with cerebral palsy are unable to achieve muscle control and coordination. Cerebral palsy is non-progressive, non-contagious and permanent. The incidence of Cerebral palsy is 2-2.5 persons per 1000 live births, and the estimated population of CP cases in India is approximately 25 lakhs (cited from publicly available information).\nApproximately 40-55% of people with CP are affected in all muscles below the head (quadriplegia and diplegia). In most of these cases, these include the muscles that produce speech, and such persons are consequently non-verbal. In conjunction with their inability to move their hands or feet in a coordinated manner, this impairment means that they do not have access to any of the traditional ways of communication.', 'Most children with CP are of normal intelligence, and are handicapped in education and employment primarily due to their lack of communication abilities.', 'AVAZ is an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device for children with Cerebral Palsy (CP). AVAZ is a portable speech synthesizer which can be controlled by gross motor movements of a child with CP, such as approximate movement of the head or of large muscle groups. These movements are captured by the use of a touch-screen or an external switch to allow the child to create text sentences on the device using predictive software, and this text is read out by the device. AVAZ is thus an artificial voice for the child.', 'Invention Labs began engaging with IIT Madras and Vidya Sagar to develop commercially viable Voice Output Communication Aids in 2008. Sustained research and development on the device began in May 2008 in collaboration with Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Departments at IIT Madras. Invention Labs received a grant of Rs 10 lakhs under the Technopreneur Promotion Programme (TePP) from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India, in February 2009, which was used to fund the development of AVAZ in part.', 'Invention Labs continuously engaged with Vidya Sagar’s teachers and students to validate the usability and impact of the prototypes of the device. After a couple of rounds of prototyping and based on feedback from children as well as teachers, the design was finalized, and the beta version of the device went into production. AVAZ was launched in February 2010 and has been warmly welcomed by the community of special educators as a step in the right direction.', 'AVAZ consists of two components – a wheelchair mountable speech synthesizer and text prediction software that runs on this synthesizer. The speech synthesizer has been designed to be usable by children with different abilities and has the following features:', 'The text prediction software helps children do two things – creating sentences and speaking them out. Sentences are created in AVAZ using a technique called ‘scanning’. The user can select an option by pressing anywhere on the touchscreen or by using any contact or non-contact switch that is connected to the speech synthesizer. In order to speed up text creation, AVAZ features learning and prediction. It is able to remember sentences and words used by the child in the past, and it accelerates the entry of commonly used templates. AVAZ currently supports nearly 10000 words in the English language, and many more can be added by the child if needed.', 'The text prediction software comes with many options to enable children to customize the device to suit their needs:\na.\tScan speed can be modified to suit the child’s comfort\nb.\tAudio mode is available to help visually impaired children hear the current position of the highlight\nc.\tNew words can be added by the user to the in-built dictionary of AVAZ.\nd.\tFrequently used sentences can be added as a ‘template’ for quick retrieval', '\nAVAZ provides a ‘voice’ to a non-verbal child with Cerebral Palsy, allowing him/her to communicate with friends, family and teachers.', 'Communication plays a very important role in our lives and enables people to make friends, influence others and interact with their communities in meaningful ways. Our goal is to enable non-verbal persons with different abilities to overcome the barriers in communication that they face with the help of assistive devices like AVAZ. Just like a person with mild visual impairment wears spectacles to correct her/his vision, we envision that most non-verbal persons will have access to and use a portable assistive device like AVAZ to ‘speak’ and communicate.\nInvention Labs plans to leverage the many features of AVAZ to extend its use to an educational environment, where the children could be taught using AVAZ. Special-purpose applications could also be built that work in specific employment opportunities to help such children take up gainful employment when they graduate. AVAZ could also be interfaced to a PC or a mobile phone in order for non-verbal CP children to use these devices.\nSince a child can interact with AVAZ in multiple ways, the same principles used by a child with CP to communicate can be extended to help other non-verbal children. Children with lower levels of CP, Autistic children, children with learning disabilities and children with multiple disabilities could all benefit from having an assistive device that suits their needs. With the appropriate application, AVAZ could potentially be useful by adults who have been temporarily or permanently impaired by accident, stroke, disease or even old age.', 'Invention Labs is a startup based out of Chennai and incubated at IIT Madras. Voted one of the hottest startups in India by Business Today in 2009, Invention Labs was founded by alumni of IIT Madras. With a diversity of experience gained from working for multinational corporations at different locations worldwide, the founding members of Invention Labs returned to India in 2007 to set up Invention Labs as an organization that invents products for the unmet needs of the Indian consumer.\n', '\nRead more about Avaz (and watch their video) here: http://www.inventionlabs.in/avaz/aboutAVAZ.html\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
1,2010-3,"['Written by Rahul Anand', 'Interview: Janet Yegneshwaran – Trees For Free']","['Everyone knows the benefits of planting trees: cleaner air, good monsoons, no global warming. But most of us don’t get the time or sometimes don’t really have the inclination to go that extra mile to plant a tree. Trees for Free is a wonderful organization that has taken up this initiative in Bangalore. They involve volunteers and companies, inspiring them to give \xa0back to the environment. Corporate houses can become a Tree Planting Member as part of their CSR activity and adopt a cause whose benefits will be felt across the globe for years and generations to come.', 'Individuals can become a ‘Tree Planting Member’ , by donating\xa0 a minimum of 100 Rupees for 1 tree a month.', 'Here’s an interview with Janet Yegneshwaran, Founder of Trees For Free.', 'In 2005 when I wanted to start a Trust in memory of my late husband, there was lot of tree cutting in Bangalore and everybody were crying over this. So I thought it is better to be positive instead of crying over the felled tree, and started planting trees.', 'Q: What was your background before starting Tree For Free? The obstacles you faced in setting up the organization?\nI was a landscape artist before I started Trees For Free. Initially I had to go around the neighbourhood\xa0with friends, and volunteers, knocking on doors to ask\xa0them if they would look after a tree planted in front of their house.\xa0 Most of them were for it except a few who preferred keeping the place for parking of their car and some of them did not like the idea of a tree in front of their house as the trees shed a lot of leaves and they will have the added job of sweeping the leaves.', 'Q: I believe a lot of us want to plant trees, but we don’t know where to plant, how does Tree For Free scout a site for plantation?\nEarlier we used to go door-to-door.\xa0 Now with the media exposure, people who want to plant trees, who have found places for planting and who are ready to look after the saplings planted have started contacting us.\xa0 Now our role is to only plant it for them.', 'Q: What is the kind of socio economic, ecological impact the organization is generating?\nPeople who want to plant trees inside their compound, on their roads and nearby schools etc., and who have no monitory support or do not have the know-how of planting can\xa0now contact our organisation and we plant it free for them.', 'Similarly, Corporates and green groups who want to plant, who can afford the expenses but do not know how and where to plant,\xa0can come to us. We will not only show them the place to plant where it will be looked after, we will keep the place and the saplings ready for planting .They and their representatives can come to the site of planting and plant it themselves. In case they are unable to, they can still sponsor the saplings and our volunteers will plant it for them.', 'Lot of trees are being cut in Bangalore, almost every day\xa0and lots more are on the anvil. Our aim is to plant trees all over Bangalore wherever they could be looked after, to see that\nthe greenery is brought back to Bangalore.', 'Q: What has been the general feedback of volunteers?', '\nAll our volunteers are very happy to plant trees.\xa0Most of the places where we plant are filled with debris and filth all over.\xa0When they start planting, in the frenzy they do not see any of these.\xa0They put their hands without even thinking and plant trees. The feedback is great and they spread word about our website to their friends in turn.', 'Q: Any corporate partners, sponsors you are associated with?\nMany corporates have been partnering with us –\xa0Yahoo! Software Development Pvt. Ltd. plants trees for the birthdays of their employees.\xa0Harley Davidson has collected fees for test drives for Trees for Free.\xa0Aditya Birla Group has kept a portion of the price on Van Heusen Cotton Shirts for tree planting. Once, the car in which we were carting the saplings broke down before time and the Volunteers and Applied Materials India Pvt., Ltd, have come forward to contribute and we have been presented with a 5-seater Bolero Camper Gold with a tipper to facilitate transport of trees, workers, tree-guards and tools.', 'Shell, Perot Systems, WPA World Class Service, Applied Materials, India Pvt. Ltd., etc., have all been sponsoring the tree planting.', 'Q: Could you explain the various initiatives Trees For Free is running? Like the Gift For Free ? \nCSR is a huge part of what we do.\xa0 We also have Gift Certificates which we issue to people who want to sponsor trees and gift them to friends.', 'Q: How do you plan to take it forward?\nThere is a lot of space in Bangalore for trees and lots more are becoming empty every day. People from Schools, Colleges, Hospitals, Gated Communities etc., have started coming forward to ask us to plant trees for them.\xa0 We have been covering a distance of only 30 kms\nfrom the city center so far.\xa0 Now we have started getting requests from places like Ramanagaram (a district near Bangalore).\nWe have already planted trees in a village school in Muthur, 75 kms away from Bangalore and in Malur.\xa0We hope to take this initiative to many further places.\xa0 We also hope that Corporates come forward\nto sponsor bamboo tree-guards so that we can start planting on the roadsides wherever people have shown us the place to plant.', 'The Better India Team wishes Trees For Free all the best in making this country green.', 'Site: http://www.treesforfree.org/\nBlog: http://treesforfree.blogspot.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/treesforfree/', 'Writer, Researcher interested in social enterprise, innovation, culture and networks.

Far from rat race of the cities, situated in Kochivelli, IISE campus is a perfect amalgamation of modernization, simplicity and technicality.', 'IISE was established as a part of BWB (Braille Without Borders) with an initial vision of finding visually-challenged children with a passion to grow and give them the tools to function independently in society. Sabriye Tenberken, the founder BWB, lost her vision at the age of 12. She went from Germany to Tibet after hearing the terrible circumstances in which the visually-challenged children there lived. She always felt stifled by the constraints on the visually-impaired in Germany and hence decided to work with others who were facing the same pressures but under much more extreme conditions. Sabriye met Paul Kronenberg while she was in Tibet who later went on to create BWB together.', 'It began as an initiative to create Tibetan Braille and grew into a printing press for Tibetan Braille literature. Then a preparatory school for the primary education of blind children was established. To realize the idea of the blind as an independent section of the society, they opened a vocational training school which provided them employment skills and encouraged entrepreneurship. This included things like cheese farming, animal husbandry, gardening, theatre and painting.', 'After establishing the centre in Tibet, their objective evolved from empowering the visually-impaired to creating leaders within any marginalized group that would act as a catalyst for change. Hence they moved to this idyllic location in Kerala and started IISE.', 'BWB runs almost wholly on donations and grants. The ethos of the organization is to help as many people as rapidly as possible, and BWB believes that an open-source model is most effective. Naturally, there is some risk in relying on the goodwill of others to sustain it, so BWB focuses on maximizing its use of capital.', 'The impact that BWB has had on people can be seen on social, economic as well as the political front. Empowering blind people helps not only themselves but also every individual who interacts with them; the organization that employs them. BWB is demonstrating that not only can blind people be contribute significantly to the society, that they can infact be leaders.', 'Talking about the economic impact, tooling up 161 million blind people provides as an invaluable work resource. These marginalized groups are able to create assets and jobs as much as anyone else.', 'For more details on BWB/IISE, check out http://staging.bwb-iise.org/', 'To know more about Sabriye, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabriye_Tenberken', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
