Like many others, it is hard for me to figure how to start doing my bit to make things better. Then, I stumble upon an inspiring story and I start afresh, with the same vigour. This time my inspiration comes from a foreigner who is working day and night to make the lives of street children in India better. Mary Gothi, along with her husband Dave, founded the Sunshine Ministries in 2005 to make a more permanent difference in the lives of hurting street children of India.', 'In times when many Indians also shy away from fulfilling their moral responsibility towards their nation, someone like Mary stepping in to contribute whatever she can makes all the difference. Discussing the beginning of this humble journey, Mary explains, “We began Sunshine Kids International in 2005.  I had traveled to Mumbai with my husband, Dave (Devendra) for years and just felt we needed to do something more significant and permanent to make a difference in the lives of kids I would meet on the street. Our nephew, Vivek Gothi, was familiar with St. Catherine’s of Siena orphanage in Mumbai and directed us to Brother Joseph there. We decided to run a sponsorship program and the gifts of partners to support St. Catherine’s in many ways. We support their Happy Feet and Happy Home programmes, help pay the salaries of their teachers, counselors and social workers.”', 'Mary herself is a psychotherapist, which is one reason why she is interested in healing the child, holistically. “Each child is encouraged to discover their heart, the passion God has placed in them to pursue,” she feels.', 'Mary Gothi and her husband Dave, who is an engineer by profession, are fully committed to the cause of supporting and helping street children live a normal childhood. Mary explains, “We have partnered with St. Catherine’s to helping them build the lives of children who might otherwise never had the opportunity to not only better themselves, but make a real difference in their communities.  Many of these children are street kids who now have the chance, through the Project: Age 22, to receive education in the fields of their choice and are encouraged until they are placed in a job at the age of 22! We are supporting this program by helping Americans, who are so blessed financially, to understand what the rest of the world is like and to be willing to leave their comfort zone to make a difference.  Raising money for this project has been a constant leap of faith. We are a volunteer-led organization, but I can’t count on that forever!”', 'Apart from convincing Americans to make a contribution, Mary has also faced the constant challenge of making Indians understand that the caste system does not mean that God wants people trapped or unable to fulfill their potential. Mary often tells people, “God wants every child to have the opportunity to make a difference in the world! Every child, if given the chance, can make India a better place!”', 'After learning so much about Mary’s journey, one can’t help but feel uncomfortable in referring to her as a ‘foreigner’ as she has truly become a part of India and is striving to make it better. Mary explains, “I love India, I love my in-laws and I always felt we could do something to make India a better place for the kids I would meet, fall in love with and then leave after my visits, not knowing what would happen to them.  I was tired of having a broken heart and had to do something!”\n\nWhat drove Mary towards this noble work, in spite of being a foreigner? She adds, “Maybe as an ‘outsider’ I see things with different eyes?  I could never get used to the poverty I experienced in India or the begging children. I couldn’t believe that this was just their ‘lot in life’ or what God would accept for them. I wanted more for them!  Maybe if we found a place we could partner with, we could really make a difference just in our little corner of the world!  And that has happened in ways that continue to amaze me.”', 'Mary’s story doesn’t end here. Sunshine Kids International is only a beginning. Even her daughter Maren and her husband TJ, have adopted a child Lola from India, from Ashraya Home in Bangalore. Because of Lola’s multiple physical deformities, her parents could not take care of her and her special needs. Lola Swapna has been an amazing gift to the family, as has been the family’s priceless care for many children.', 'Reach out to Mary and Dave at info@sunshinekidsintl.com\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', ""Co-Founder of Serene Woods portal for authors and photographers, I have authored two books - 'Drenched Soul' (poetry) and 'If At All' (fiction).

3,2010-9,"['Written by Unnati Narang', 'Chitrashala: Keeping Phad Art alive']","['\n\n\nby\n\nUnnati Narang\n\n\nSeptember 24, 2010, 9:20 am \n\n\n', 'It is not uncommon to hear of India’s cultural marvels, unique local traditions and unmatched contributions to handmade art works. Yet, only when one goes beyond these fancy sounding words to really explore India’s majestic heritage is one exposed to how rich our inheritance truly is. One such work of art, born in the land of folklore, Rajasthan, is the Phad paintings. These are huge paintings done on cloth, and depict stories of the local deities and gods. Scale of the figures in the painting depicts their social status of the character in the story. What is also interesting is that the figures face each other, not the audience.', 'Phad paintings are unique because as per traditions, a thirty feet long and five feet wide work is done only be using natural vegetable colours. Additionally, material like squirrel hair is also used. The essence of these paintings is that they are completely natural. Yet, this has, in recent years, proven to be detriment to the popularity of Phad paintings because of a scarcity of these natural colours. Preserving this wonderful form of art is what motivated Shree Lal ji Joshi, a world-renowned Phad artist and Padma Shree and Shilpguru award winner.', 'Joshi ji founded Chitrashala, a pioneer institute for training in different styles of paintings of Rajasthan and especially for Phad painting (Mewar Style) more than fifty years ago. The art itself is more than seven hundred years old. There was a time when the secrets of Phad painting were confined to the Joshi family. However, when Joshi ji felt that the art form was slowly dwindling away, he felt the need to establish ‘Joshi Kala Kunj’, now ‘Chitrashala’ in 1960 to develop new artists other than the Joshi family. He virtually challenged all orthodox ideas for the sake of art. He took upon himself the task of revitalizing this art, even at the international level. ', 'Artists at workHe conducted workshops, approached media and spoke to masses in India and abroad about Phad paintings. He guided both his sons Kalyan and Gopal Joshi in adding new dimensions to this art. ', 'Kalyan Joshi Ji explains, “Phad paintings originate in our family. Initially even the daughters in the family were not taught its secrets. As a result of the practices of keeping the art within the family, our ancestors started noticing that it was losing its popularity. Hence, we took up the task of bringing it back. Me and my brother, under our father’s guidance and blessings, also started a formal school for institutionalizing Phad art learning, fifteen years ago. I regularly conduct workshops. I visit schools to give live demonstrations so that he coming generations can learn about the art and what’s so special about it. There are only 13 remaining Phad artists in India. This traditional art can only live if it is learnt and practiced correctly. For example, there is a method to make natural paints. We make our own colours and first test them before painting. Only then can one ensure the long life of a painting. We have paintings as old as 200 years!”', 'Kalyan Ji has taken up this mission with brother Gopal Joshi and is happy to see some of the artists that his father had taught winning national awards for the art. He is motivated, and humbly so, every time he meets a new audience to speak to, about this wonderful art. He also can’t help but praise the artists because so much hard work goes into Phad paintings; sometimes it can take almost 2 months to finish one painting. Kalayan Ji speaks highly of some well known artists, who have excelled in this profession, “Pradeep Mujherjee, a Bengali artist, learnt from my father back in the 1970s under the guru-shishya parampara. He won the National Award in 1985. There is also Rameshwar Singh, in Jaipur who later devised his own unique style, using modern touches to enhance Phad art. He won the LKA award. The interesting part is that every painting has a story. So, by preserving this art, we also preserve stories that have traversed thousands of years by word of mouth and hearsay, from our ancestry.”\nKalyan Joshi at Chitrashala\nWhile those born in the Joshi family started learning the Phad traditions in their early years, the children of today’s times suffer from an overload of information and may never know about the wonder of Rajasthan’s most cherished art form. It is this fear and a strong determination to overcome it that has led these Phad artists to pursue greater goals. In the age of communication technologies, all one can hope for is that this art can reach out to all those who have an appreciative eye and who love India for its true glory.', 'You can take a look at this wonderful collage of their works here: http://phadchitra.com/gallery.htm', 'Chitrashala\n(Phad Painting Training & Research Institute)\nOpp. Mataji ki Gali, Sanganeri Gate, Bhimganj,\nBhilwara City , State-Rajasthan 311001 (India)\nEmail: kalyanpjoshi[at]yahoo[dot]com\nWeb: http://phadchitra.com/\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', ""Co-Founder of Serene Woods portal for authors and photographers, I have authored two books - 'Drenched Soul' (poetry) and 'If At All' (fiction).

It is up to us how fast we finish an order and get to another one,” says Mujeeb, a craftsman of Channapatna, or what is known as the Toy Town of Karnataka. Wherever you look in this town, you will find toys, wooden crafts and people with toys in varying degrees of completion in their hands. Channapatna, situated in Ramanagaram district and 60 km away from Bangalore, is home to more than 5,000 skilled craftsmen who produce wooden and ivory craft including bangles, earrings, toys, even beaded car sear covers.', 'Channapatna’s legacy of toys goes back to the time of Tipu Sultan. More than two centuries back, Tipu had invited Persian artisans to train the locals of Channapatna. They started with carving toys out of ivory; later they switched to rubber, cedar and teak.', 'A 200-year old legacy however found itself on shaky ground when the markets were flooded with ‘Made in China’ products; low cost Chinese toys and plastic playthings soon replaced indigenous toys. Livelihoods were threatened, but thankfully not for long. The government and NGOs were able to rein in the damage and transformed Channapatna’s state of affairs. “My friends back home working on toys earn much more than what I do, here in Bangalore. They earn Rs 250 to Rs 300 per day,” says Lokesh, a resident of Channapatna, employed as an office assistant in Bangalore.', 'Today, many who had migrated to big cities in search of jobs have returned to Channapatna to bolster its lost-and-found glory.” Earlier, it was difficult to find work orders owing to the absence of an organised system in place. Now we get encouragement and work orders from both government and private organisations. That is why residents of Channapatna are happy to stay back,” says Shami Ulla, a local craftsman.', 'At a government craft complex that TSI visited, nearly 20-25 members were engaged in paring wood on machines to make it easier for craftsmen to carve designs on them. A few craftsmen were on the floor giving final touches to toys and other pieces of art. A major buyer of these handicrafts – since 40 years – is Cauvery Emporium; rest of the goods are either sold to local shops or are exported. An area of six acres, with more than 250 families working away at chiselling, making, designing and colouring the handicrafts, is set aside to meet the Cauvery Emporium order.', 'The land is provided by the government and spending Rs 150 for electricity is not a big outlay, but a major problem is load shedding. “The government has not fixed salaries. They have just given us a place to work. We arrange wood, lacquer and other necessary materials. It is a good thing that the government buys our product,” says Shami Ulla. Shami Ulla volunteered to take us around town to show us more houses engaged in toy-making. We visited Hanumanthiah and his family who were busy with designing and colouring dolls and idols. His children also helped out after their school hours. “We earn a minimum of Rs 5000 to Rs 6000 per month. We are required to colour and design and fix the half done art pieces,” says Hanumanthiah.', 'The next house was Rukkamma’s – she and her son were so busy with preparing wooden beads that they answered our queries without taking eyes off the hand driven machine! Rukkamma was rotating a wooden stick and skillfully cut the tip of the stick in the shape of an oval bead with a thread; in 15 minutes she had finished making 15 beads.', 'As in any other cottage industry, the middlemen here too walk away with the best deal, while the manufacturers make only a meager profit. Rukkamma gets only 75 paisa per bead; the middleman sells the same for Rs 1.50. These beads go to cover car seats that retail for Rs 800-Rs. 1000.”', 'Decades back, toys were booming business in the country, but that was of course before the Chinese took control of the market. The local produce was pushed to obscurity; it’s only in the last 3-4 years that the market is looking up again. “NGOs are training us; we are learning new designs. We get orders on a regular basis. I earn Rs 200 to Rs 300 daily here. We are however allowed to work only from 10am to 5pm. All other private factories work day and night. If the government allowed us to work late nights, we could earn more too,” says Mujeeb, who works in a government shop floor.', 'Private enterprises do good business out of this art; fifteen to twenty of such companies get orders from overseas as well. “There is great demand from UK and the US. Private companies earn around Rs 5 lakh per month by exporting. They get business with their own efforts,” says H.K. Sahukaiah, Planning Officer of the government workshop in the town. The traders still carp about the Chinese deluge though. “We used to get positive responses from buyers 5-6 years back. But nowadays Chinese items are the rage. People obviously like cheaper goods,” says MP Mariswamy, a trader of toys in Channapatna.', 'For the locals, income of Rs 5000 to Rs 6,000 per month holds good to lead a fairly decent life in this small town. Besides, nearly 1000 registered members also avail benefits from government schemes to encourage the cottage industry, which include the central government fund for training on new designs, and health scheme, apart from the loan recommendations for providing craftsmen with more facilities.', 'Channapatna is a fine model of public–private enterprise leveraging local talent for the welfare of the community and to the benefit of the exchequer.

Whatever falls on them makes an impression.” The daunting task before a nation such as ours, where inclusive growth is the only sustainable path, is to make sure that our future generation undergoes the right experiences in their formation years. The right experience means not only quality education but also the correct exposure. Unless we can provide for our children, the future of the nation as a whole remains doubtful.', 'St. Catherine’s of Siena Home and School for Destitute Children, located in Mumbai, India, has over 250 children to provide for.\xa0 Created as the Welfare Society for Destitute Children, the school/orphanage was established by Father Anthony Elenjimittam, a friend of Mahatma Gandhi, who was his mentor. Since 1957, St. Catherine’s has cared for and educated children of lower castes who are deemed by the culture as unworthy of education.', 'Brother Joseph (standing in the middle in this photograph), currently the Director at St. Catherine’s explains, “We started as an organisation to educate students who never attended regular school. Father Anthony started teaching such children. Today, we are catering to street children and the orphaned here. We also run our own primary school. The reason for doing so is because we wish to cater to street children, which the other schools might not be open to. Secondly, many of our students are overage, for example, even ten year olds are studying in our kindergarten classes. We are tackling many issues such as behavioural problems in children. These children have a background of working as labourers and they find it very difficult to start writing or studying. With our counselling sessions, we make sure that they can overcome such learning hurdles.”', 'In addition to education, they have provided shelter, food and clothing to kids in need of a safe haven and love. Helping them heal from the trauma of abandonment and abuse that many of them have experienced is a priority. Committed to the physical, spiritual and emotional well-being of these children, they offer healing and hope through a holistic program of counselling and therapy using art, dance and music.', 'Brother Joseph emphatically states the need to appreciate multiple intelligence. He feels that only when children are allowed to discover their true interest and passion, are they motivated to study and become something in life. Brother adds, “We encourage children to follow their interests. This helps them to later make a career out of it. For example, some children who might not be very good with academics might like working with machines and tools. They can become automotive engineers. Then there are those who love animals. We teach them about the scope of veterinary. Two of our children were there for the Dance India Dance show on TV.”', 'The kids, part of the Happy Feet Project participated in the show.

It is the goal of St. Catherine’s to not just offer short-term aid to these children, but to prepare them for a healthy and productive future that will impact their nation. What keeps Brother Joseph going? It is his undying love for children. He adds, “Gandhian ideals and social welfare keep me going. It is a challenge for me, when I see so many street children, children from dysfunctional families, etc to be able to provide them a normal, happy life. I want to grow the orphanage by looking at long term partnerships with others. It is wonderful to be able to give these children a reason to study.

10,2010-9,"['Written by Unnati Narang', 'Sikshana: Filling gaps in public education']","['\n\n\nby\n\nUnnati Narang\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2010, 11:50 am \n\n\n', 'Every morning, as I walk to the bus stand, I cross a local school here, a government school. I hear loud singing voices; the same songs every morning – the prayers and the national anthem. I pause and smile. School is such a beautiful feeling! Only when I am returning home in the afternoon do I mutter curses under my breath. Swarms of children run madly in all directions in and out of the school. With their uniform loosely hanging over their bodies and a few torn books falling out of their bags, I see the dismal picture of ‘education’. I wish these kids had a way to study at better schools, where they would truly be educated. There could also be an alternate option. Why not improve the quality of education in these government schools? That’s exactly what Sikshana does.', 'In 2002, Mr. E S\xa0Ramamurthy, retired chairman of BHEL in Bangalore wanted to work on a social cause. He started working with a primary school to understand their functioning and their problems. Initially he remained associated with aangan badis, overseeing the midday meal programmes. Yet, after it was taken up by the government, Ramamurthy decided to do something more. He decided to focus on the quality of education in government schools and act as a facilitator. The founder member of Sivasri Trust, which operates Sikshana, Ramamurthy started out in 2004. In the next one year, he could cover ten schools. Since then, there his idea has known no bounds. He gradually strengthened the Trust and found more board members. In 2007, one of the funders, Mr V.R. Prasanna, having returned from the US after 16 years, joined the Board as a fulltime Director.', 'Prasanna explains the Sikshana model, “I realised that the model was very successful and could be replicated. I joined as the Programme Director with a view to scale it up. It is a decentralized approach. We try to understand the basic needs of each school, based on the village and community conditions. The idea was to empower schools by disbursing funds and bring in management concepts. Since 99% of our schools are in rural areas, we noticed that students found it difficult to express what they knew. Hence, we focused on four skills – Read, Write, Compute and Express!”', 'What started with ten schools has today grown to 375 schools, covering almost 50 000 students. Sikshana acts as a facilitator, providing resources and guidance to the schools. In India, 90% of all children in the 6-14 age group attend a public school, which is why the Sikshana team felt that any meaningful effort to improve the educational standards of the new generation should necessarily start here. The value additions are countless. Take technology, for instance. Prasanna explains, “We started our initiative of providing one laptop per school and one pendrive per child. Being able to access a computer helps children overcome their fear of technology. Kids are even learning English faster, because of computers. We have English-Kannada dictionary installed in every system. We make sure every child comes forward to use the facility. We also help those who excel or are able to do better than the others by conducting summer technology camps for them. At the end of every year, we organise a computer summit, across schools. Two students from each school give presentations. This increases their confidence levels. We know that our students will be able to become whatever they want in life, because of the kind of exposure they get.”', 'Many individuals who want to make a difference in the society often wonder how they would do it all by themselves. When I look at Sikshana and the magnitude, impact and diversity of their projects, I am assured that anything is possible if you want it bad enough. Prasanna writes on the Sikshana blog, “With Sikshana yet to hit the 20 employee mark and the need to manage nearly 375 schools in 7 blocks, a question that naturally comes to one’s mind is how is Sikshana able to conduct such large events in addition to mentoring all the schools.\xa0I am seeing increasing signs of the teachers and the department taking ownership of Sikshana. An increasing number of teachers have started to believe in themselves.”', 'Thus, on one hand children are imbued with an enthusiasm to learn actively and on the other, the staff is more aware of its role and potential. With Skishana playing the facilitator, the day is not far when public schools will be at par with, if not superior to, the private schools.\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', ""Co-Founder of Serene Woods portal for authors and photographers, I have authored two books - 'Drenched Soul' (poetry) and 'If At All' (fiction).
