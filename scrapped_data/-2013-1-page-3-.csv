Something illegal? Nefarious? Criminal? Well, here’s an organization that has taken the infamous term and given a completely positive spin to it. This is through the events it holds every year, calling technologists from all over the world to come together and build solutions for humanitarian problems using open source platform. These events are, very appropriately, called Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK).', 'They are driven by their belief that every human being seeks the joy of service; and that given the opportunity, people around the world will dedicate their time and skills to creating a positive impact in society. Looking at the numbers that turn up for their ‘Hackathons’, their premise seems to be founded on solid ground. For many years now, RHoK has been working to create a self-sustaining global community of innovators building practical open technology solutions for challenges facing humanity, both locally and globally.', 'How does RHoK work?\nRHoK achieves its purpose by bringing together technology experts, communities and organizations together in order to define real world problems and work towards an acceptable solution. This is done by hosting weekend ‘Hackathons’ around the globe at the same time twice a year.', 'On 1-2 December 2012, 30 cities in 18 countries around the world hosted RHoK hackathons. Bangalore and Pune joined in from India to hack for humanity along with like-minded hackers from other countries.', 'The Bangalore Hackathon:\nRHoK hackathon in Bangalore was hosted at office of the Center for Internet and Society (CIS). Over the weekend the office of CIS was filled with frantic keystrokes and discussions to get some proof of concept that techies had in mind to be transformed into reality.', 'On Saturday morning at 9:00am the subject matter experts presented the problem statement they were sponsoring and the techies chose what they wanted to solve and how they wished to do it. After that the techies formed teams and started hacking over the weekend. Around 30 techies formed 5 teams in Bangalore, and 1 team was working from Chennai, so totally 6 teams worked on the problems over the weekend. The hackers made the most of the time they had over the weekend, some of them stayed overnight at CIS to get some more work done. At the end of the day and half of hacking the teams came up with their proof of concept / work in progress which was judged by a panel of judges.', 'The Hacks Developed at RHoK Bangalore 1-2 December 2012:\n1. Help for Cause: This team was working with Greenpeace. The idea of the hack was to bring the NGOs (who need volunteer time) and weekend volunteers (who have volunteer time) together on technology platforms including mobiles and web. The team worked over weekend to come up with an iPhone app as a proof of concept.', '2. Green Trails Project: This problem statement was presented by India Hikes. Trekkers go to the mountains and take a lot of necessary things along like bottles of water, food packets, etc, and many a times leave the waste behind in the hills polluting the hill’s ecosystem. This team worked on gamification of incentives program for the trekkers who will clean up the hills out of goodwill or for incentives. The team came up with a nice web-based application as proof of concept for the same.', '3. Data visualization for NGO reports: The problem was presented by Amnesty International. It asked for data representation on a map along with timeline to be available on web for creating awareness. One individual hacker worked on this to come up with a timeline to represent the report.', '4. Micro Finance report customization: A team of developers from HP worked with Micro Finance Open Source (mifos) for extending the mifos platform functionality by developing a module to create a template to get custom reports for the micro finance institutions. The team came up with an almost finished product in Bangalore and a similar product was developed by a team from Chennai who worked over the weekend from that location. HP employees from 4 locations around the world: Bangalore, Chennai, Dublin & San Francisco were working on MIFOS project at this RHoK, this whole HP-MIFOS project was coordinated by Social Coding for Good.', '5. Missing children: A problem presented by Mr. Praveen, a designer from Yahoo Labs, who narrated a story of his friend from Kanpur, a roadside vendor who lost his son and couldn’t trace him in the city. This problem seeks to get a smart phone app where people will click snaps of homeless children on the road, railway stations, bazaars, etc. These photos will be stored on a server along with their location data and whenever some parents upload their missing child’s photo, then the database of the photos will be searched for matching face and the location will be given. The team came up with server side app for uploading the photos and location data as a proof of concept.', 'The judges for the event were luminaries from different walks of life like the corporate sector, development sector, investor community, academia, etc. No doubt they had a difficult time selecting the best hacks from the ones presented on the final day. The event ended with the teams resolving to meet over the next few weekends to finish the pending work on their projects, and see it implemented in real life.', 'It is heartening to see many of these ideas being taken to execution stage with the potential to impact many lives, as I witnessed at the previous hackathon, held in June 2012, when I was judging the event and was highly impressed by the solutions presented by the teams. One hack that really stood out was an SOS application called Bachao that acted as a witness for crimes and an alert system in case one felt one was in distress. The team continued working on it after the event, and their app has now been incubated by Geeks Without Bounds. We hope to see it available on our phones very soon!', 'To know more about RHoK events, and how you could participate, visit the website: http://www.rhok.org/ or get in touch with Yogesh Londhe at: yoga1103@gmail.com', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Or the dearth of genuine information, free from media biases, available to the general public about the politicians serving our nation or asking for our votes? Well, here is a website that attempts to solve these problems, and empower the voters in the country to be better informed about the choices they are faced with.', 'RTI or the Right to Information is a fundamental right of every citizen of India according to the Constitution. A group of IIT Bombay students and alumni including Ashish Rathi, Hitesh Lalwani, Pramjeet Kumar, Rahul Shrivastava, Rituraj Shukla, Siddharth Bidwan and Sidharth Mishra have set out to give a new dimension to this right in the form of Netapedia. Though almost all of us have a handful of complaints ready when it comes to Indian politics and politicians, very few of us possess any actual knowledge about the same. We know very little about our politicians’ backgrounds and past activities that could enable us to understand them better. The astonishing fact is that though an average Indian would do adequate research before spending some money on toothpaste, he/she does not do any prior study before choosing the leaders of his country. How can one be expected to cast a suitable vote during the elections if the decision is not an informed one? How can Indian administration be truly democratic if the people do not cast genuine and legitimate votes?', 'In order to address this situation, Netapedia has come into existence to provide us with the missing information. It is a platform that provides us with authentic profiles of Indian politicians based on the affidavits filed by them before the elections along with the MPLADS (Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme) – summary for each of the MPs. Aside from this information on individual politicians, the website also offers the latest news on Indian politics and a variety of analyses on the ongoing activities. The chief goal is to provide accurate information on important past as well as present national events and elections to the common man, and learning citizens’ feedback on the same. Netapedia plans to develop interactive content to engage citizens in fun activities while educating them and making them aware about the Indian Bureaucracy and the country’s political evolution over the years.', 'All the data piled up on their website, including information about politicians’ education, moveable and immoveable assets, legal history, votes cast in their favour, work record in their constituencies, etc. can work wonders in filling up the communication and knowledge gap between the people and the politicians. The data is procured by the website from authentic sources like the Constitution of India, the Parliament, the Indian Penal Code, and the Budget. Some of the popularly sought out politicians on Netapedia include Sonia Gandhi, Kapil Sibal, Sushma Swaraj, L. K. Advani, Asaduddin Owaisi and Kamal Nath. It also displays some very interesting facts like ‘Elections in 1950s were carried out using different ballot boxes for each candidate, rather than voting on ballot paper! Different coloured boxes represented different parties.’', 'The venture is a registered entity now, as a non-profiting, non-governmental organisation (NGO). The idea, first conceived by the developers in November 2010 was launched as a portal in October 2011 and has steadily grown in popularity and viewership in the last year. The response of the audience has been quite encouraging, who find the information well presented, structured and user-friendly. Netapedia is certainly on its way to becoming a comprehensive and insightful information provider on Indian politicians and politics.', 'More volunteers are being attracted and more features are being added in order to make the initiative more professional. The action plan includes an interactive blog containing views from the users and experts, a section to compare the different politicians, a section exclusively on analysis, a newsletter, a section with user-generated content, etc. They also have their own Facebook and Twitter pages in order to reach the audience via the popular social media forums. The main challenges that they expect are the procurement of data at the state level and the constant updating of the site as per user needs.', 'In a society where media plays quite an influential role, it can be appreciated that the portal can play a very effective role in providing an objective database on the politicians. No purposeful focus on the dirt to provide the audience with the requisite masala or deliberate focus on the good side as a result of corruption. The large number of politicians around and the very confusing and complex stories that are played on the media about them does not allow a layman to form a legitimate opinion. Netapedia can certainly be the answer to your prayers in such a situation.', 'On a concluding note, it must be again highlighted how essential and critical it is for Indians to have a good understanding of their politicians and representatives. We must all take a healthy interest in the activities around us, determine the good as well as the bad in the administration and thus, make an informed decision during elections. Awareness among the people is something that will definitely bring about accountability in the system.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

This time, Ejipura’s slum dwellers, dumped in the streets by BBMP, are getting their support.', 'Aruna Chandrasekhar’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing since Tuesday evening. Her desperate call for relief for people at Ejipura had actually reached a significant number of people. This, thanks to involved citizens reaching out through their personal and social networks.', 'Aruna, in her twenties, is a freelance photographer and writer has long been involved in social activism, particularly in environmental and mining-related issues. On the morning of January 18th, her friend and activist Kaveri Indira Rajaraman, a post-doctoral fellow at the Indian Institute of Science, called her. Kaveri has been fighting for the rights of those residing in Ejipura EWS (Economically Weaker Section) quarters for quite some time. Ejjipura is adjacent to Koramangala in south Bengaluru.', 'Aruna started spreading the word, especially after Kaveri and several other activists and protesters were detained by police the next day. Shortly thereafter, she herself reached the site to help with relief efforts near the razed site where the EWS Quarters once stood, and has been there since, co-ordinating relief and communication*. The people who have not been able to find any alternative settlement are now spending their days and nights in the open.', 'BBMP’s demolition drive of last week, which has seen thousands from Ejipura’s EWS slum quarters near Koramangala rendered homeless overnight, has sparked off a humanitarian crisis of immense proportion. As the debate continues over the legitimacy of such a drive and the brutality of the state, despair and utter dejection is the dominant mood not just among those affected but among many who wonder aloud if this is all that the economically weak can expect from the state by way of their fundamental right to shelter.', 'However, if there is any glimmer of hope in all this, it comes from the completely spontaneous and voluntary outburst of support and relief efforts undertaken not just by social activists but also organizations, student bodies and ordinary individuals moved by the plight of hundreds of women and children without access to food, drinking water, sanitation facilities and medical attention.', 'People from all walks of life have poured in at the site to help in whatever way they can and volunteers have been working tirelessly since Saturday to ensure that basic necessities reach the displaced. Simply ensuring that all these families can have two or three meals a day has been a huge exercise in logistics and coordination and it is only because citizens have joined hands with the volunteers on site that this has been possible so far.', '“We have been trying to arrange for food packets, water and blankets and have received a huge response. Organizations like Akshaya Patra had also pitched in for the first few days but such is the dimension of the crisis, that no matter how much we get, it is not enough,” says Aruna.', 'Deeply affected by the abysmal conditions in which the evicted have been living, and especially by the death of an old woman on Tuesday, possibly from cold and prolonged lack of nutrition, Aruna sounded desperate when we first spoke to her on Wednesday morning. “People don’t have drinking water here, women don’t have access to toilets, students can’t go to school or college, many fear losing their livelihoods as they haven’t been able to go to work; it’s a crisis of unimaginable proportion. We desperately need blankets to battle the night chill. Otherwise there may be more casualties…”', 'Clearly, the call for help did not go unheeded as by Wednesday night, the volunteers had received close to 400 blankets from various quarters – residents of Defence Colony, groups of IT professionals as well as individuals. A few doctors were also on the site, attending to many who need medical attention. Aruna also mentions a group of 50-60 students from St Joseph’s who have been visiting over the past couple of days, helping with distribution and other needs on the ground.', 'Demolishing on at Ejipura Slum. Pic: Julie Mcguire [www.juliemcguire.com]The extent of student participation in volunteering efforts has also been a pleasant surprise for Arati Chokshi, an activist with the Karnataka People’s Union for Civil Liberties who cannot hold back her emotion as she talks of the plight of the people and the brutal indifference of the state. But in the gloom and despondency of the situation, what gives her hope is the significant number of students that she has met at the site, who have been milling around, volunteering to help in whatever way they can.', 'One such student from the Azim Premji University, who had initially come with her friends only to gauge the realities of the issue, said that the condition of the people and the sheer amount of work and help needed on the ground has stirred her so much that she cannot stop herself from coming back repeatedly.', 'Arati also gushes at the relentless efforts of activists like Venkat and Arif, who have devoted every moment of the last few days, trying to help the residents. “It is not just their work in arranging for funds for rentals or relief material, their deep personal involvement and connect with the affected is what gives me hope for humanity,” says Arati.', 'However, despite the show of support and active volunteering from people across the city, the crisis is far from resolution. “We still need help with food and medicines, for these are not one-time needs. The challenge of continuing to provide meals for the 700 odd people who still haven’t found any place to go to is a huge one,” she points out.', 'Another volunteer, Mayank Rungta, a tech professional, who has been striving untiringly to mobilise people support and voluntary efforts echoes the need for continued monetary contributions for food and blankets as well as for physical presence, especially during lunch and dinner hours.', 'Arati is more concerned about the larger issue at stake – arrangement of alternative accommodation for the displaced. With the state unwilling to bend in the least, and many of the families entirely lacking in resources to arrange for rentals, funds mobilization is a huge challenge.', 'While a group of people, whose identity is yet to be confirmed, have pooled in money and are donating it through the mosque to people who have found rental accommodation, there has been some hesitation on the part of many to accept this. Arati is working hard to see what can be done to garner more funds. “I desperately appeal to Bangaloreans to donate for this,” she says as she fears that persistence of the situation could take a grave humanitarian toll in the long run. As a High Court hearing on the petition filed by a section of the occupants comes up next week, a lot of advocacy and legal research is also underway, says Arati.', 'While the obligations of the state and the legal rights of those displaced from these quarters will continue to be debated and discussed, the pressing need for humanitarian and monetary assistance cannot be overlooked at any cost. Ejipura needs more Samaritans, and now.', 'Those interested to contribute or help in relief efforts may contact: Kaveri Rajaraman:77602 35234 / Aruna Chandrasekhar:9886198482 / Mayank Rungta:98481 55447', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Today, she spend just half-an-hour on the same chores. What brought about this almost magical turnaround? The systematic protection of the village forest, thanks to an effective ‘van panchayat’ (forest governance unit).', 'Recalls this 32-year-old woman from Guna village of Lamgarha block in Uttarakahnd’s Almora district, “Earlier, just finding fodder, firewood and even water sources was so difficult. We women, with our children, would spend a lot of time – sometimes walking up to six kilometres every day through degraded forests, carrying back heavy headloads of fodder and firewood.” She also remembers how, because firewood and fodder were in such short supply, they would break branches off the trees even if they were not fully developed. Scarcity led to fierce competition among the women and each one would try to get up earlier in the morning so as to be the first on the scene and thus collect the maximum amount of fodder and firewood.', 'All this is history now. The van panchayat has established strict rules that everybody has to follow. Sudha Gurwant, sarpanch of the Guna village van panchayat, points out that women are now careful that they follow the set norms. For instance, they make sure that they collect only leaves instead of lopping off entire branches. Adds Gurwant, “We have also grown napier grass for fodder because it is thicker, easier to cut and ensures a good milk yield from our cattle. Now we have a large supply of this grass close to our homes and this saves time in collecting fodder. It cuts down on wastage since we harvest only what we need immediately.”', 'Not just fuel and fodder, new systems of water supply have been put in place as well. Villagers have built water storage tanks in their homes – mostly large open pits lined with plastic – at no great cost. While the materials required to build them have been funded by the Central Himalayan Environment Association (CHEA), a Nainital-based NGO, the locals have contributed their own labour to construct them.', 'In Guna, for instance, each of the 22 homes has a water tank used for various household needs, including for irrigating vegetable gardens and watering livestock. Moreover, CHEA has encouraged the villagers to dig small pits in the forest to collect rain water. This helps to stop the run-off and allows the water to percolate into the ground, providing moisture to the soil and replenishing the ground water. It has also helped to rejuvenate the sources of spring water.', 'Says local homemaker Anita Arya, “All these changes have brought us a lot of comfort. Instead of spending hours making three or four trips to distant springs to collect drinking water, we can concentrate on other activities, including income generating ones.” This means that there is now a little extra money coming into households, thanks to the general revival of the region’s natural resource base.', 'Nobody can describe the changes that have visited the region better than Padmavati, 62, of the neighbouring Tori village. Says she,', 'When I came into this village as a 13-year-old bride, it was green. We never had problems getting fodder. Over the years, I have seen our forests vanish. Thankfully, things are slowly recovering. Two years ago, I joined the van panchayat samiti and have seen what we all can achieve if we work together. These days I earn most of my income from the milk I am able to sell.', 'But there are challenges, too, and Padmavati is not one to overlook them. She is concerned about the increase in the number of forest fires in recent years. Beena Rawat, Hema and other women from neighbouring villages are equally worried. Says Beena from Thatt village, also in Lamgarha block, “Our forest caught fire four years ago and we are still waiting to get the benefits of our replanted forest.”', 'Women blame the rising temperatures, absence of winter rains, longer summers and delayed monsoons for this phenomenon. Observes Gurwant of Guna village, “We have never had a summer as hot as it was this year. I worry about the impact of this on our forest and water supply.”', 'Although these women don’t use the term ‘climate change’, they have noticed how changing weather patterns are impacting their environment. Their response has been to search for solutions – some of which certainly seem to be working seeing how the forests on these slopes appear to be getting denser. In each of the 15 villages where van panchayats are being reactivated, four out of the nine members are women, and they take a very lively interest in forest protection issues. Padmavati, for instance, stands guard for two hours every morning and evening to ensure that animals and outsiders don’t encroach on it.', 'Another aspect they keep in mind when they replant forests is to have a variety of trees rather than follow the prevalent pine monoculture model promoted by the Forest Department, which contributes to forest fires since pine needles are extremely inflammable. Oak trees are particularly favoured by the women because their roots hold rainwater ensuring that there is more moisture in the soil. “We try and pick up all fallen leaves and dried wood. This gives us manure and cooking fuel, and helps in fighting forest fires,” elaborates Anita.', 'The van panchayat samiti members want government assistance to build fences around their village forests and some support to hire forest guards to protect them from fires. Almost two-thirds of Uttarakhand is under forest cover, which is a major source of revenue – not just for the state but for ordinary people as well. So deforestation clearly undermines community well-being, which is precisely why the institution of the van panchayat is so important. It gives local people, particularly women, a stake in forest protection.', 'Sarpanch Sudha Gurwant concludes with a pithy observation, “When our van panchayats work well, our forests are healthy and our people are happy.”', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Here we invite you to take a look at the festival just gone by through her words and lens, while hoping you can make it there yourself this year!', 'The beauty about diversity in the world we live in is that at the heart of our social fabric, culture shapes our identities, aspirations and relations to others. And the myriad of cultures make the experience of living that much more colourful and vibrant.', 'The differences in cultures, both subtle and otherwise, shapes places and landscapes that we live in, and give our unique lifestyles their form. Heritage, visual and performing arts, cinema, music, publishing, fashion or design all have a place that bring to life this cultural panacea.', 'The Hornbill festival that has been showcasing the cultural canvas of Nagaland and North-east India for the last 12 years just reinforces just how brilliantly cultural and creative sector can impact social and economic development while introducing this beautiful part of the world and its people to those who come seeking to know better.', 'Celebrated in the first week of December, the festival features traditional arts, dances, folk songs, and games conducted amidst near perfect replicas of tribal hutments to the loud applause of an ever-growing enthusiastic audience. Every year, a new theme, game or contest is added to give the festival a new flavour urging even those who have experienced the festival before to be hungry for more.', 'This is was my first participation at the Hornbill, but I definitely have to go back for more. After all, I learnt there are nearly 1400 villages in Nagaland, each having a unique tradition, dance form and attire, and given that only a few get invited to perform every year, the opportunity to see the dances and other cultural events that one witnessed this year might come after a 100 years.', 'Besides, the beautiful lovely people, near-perfect management of the teeming crowds, clean utilities, exotic food and cold rice beer or Zutho to wash it down is a heady enough combination that will draw me back to Kisama village where the hub of activities during the Hornbill festival is.', 'If the mornings were rife with splashes of colour, exciting head gear and energetic dances, sundown brought the city of Kohima alive with the night bazaar, carnival and the fabulous rock shows.', 'The city of Kohima as is true with many other parts of India has severe power shortage and we got to experience the gravity of the situation first-hand. But the obvious lack of infrastructural support did not dampen either the spirit of the people or enthusiasm among the visitors. During the day, the drive down the Naga slopes in winter is a treat to the eyes. Wild poinsettias in full bloom make the entire area dressy and festive as if nature is celebrating the Christmas spirit as well.', 'The Naga food has not been influenced much by other cuisines in the region. Hunting being the favorite occupation of the people, meat is an indispensable part of the Naga cuisine, but I was pleasantly surprised at the festival that the vegetarian in me was as excited as my non-vegetarian son. Apart from the expected pork and beef specialities, bamboo shoot, lettuce wrapped sticky rice balls and yam leaves made for some fabulous vegetarian options.', 'The Naga king chilli, for which the Government of Nagaland has obtained GI rights, is widely used to add flavor and spiciness to the dishes, and consequently, most of the dishes were rather hot! It wasn’t difficult however to balance the spicy food with farm fresh fruits, especially pineapples and kiwis and yummy rice cake. I also relished the sweetness of the sticky rice tea which reminded my much of the Kerala red rice Kanji in its flavour and delicate smell.', 'The food and the local games (piglet catching, greased bamboo pole climbing, Naga chili eating and archery to name a few) kept my otherwise restless little boy so totally engaged that when it was time to leave, he literally had to be coaxed with the promise that we will be back soon!', 'The make shift art gallery, where in addition to some outstanding works of art by local artists, we also got to hear interesting voices, was a delight. The highlight was Javed Akhtar’s talk, brief but interesting, where he talked about how art can be the harbinger of progress. The Second World War museum that Kisama houses is by far the best chronicled war museum I have seen in India.', 'I would urge Hornbill festival enthusiasts to find local friends to host them around the villages between Kisama and Kohima rather than stay in the Kohima hotels. The experience just increases multi-fold when one lives and stays with the beauty and warmth of a hospitable group of people!', 'To me, the Hornbill festival was a lot more than just an annual affair of mass get together. To me it was a window to get to know an experience a beautiful part of the world, rich in tradition with its unique identity and cultural legacy. It’s a beautiful way to bring awareness about preserving the bio-diversity in the region along with its heritage while providing opportunities to the local economy to flourish.', 'The few days spent at the Hornbill makes me yearn to know more. It reminded me of how much there is to learn and experience. As I drove along the Dhansiri river on my way to Dimapur to return home, I held on to the samples of locally weaved cloth, the pictures of local birds, the masks and the bamboo utensils we bought.

The industrious residents of the slum have taken to recycling waste from across the country in order to eke out a living. Now, a unique initiative is helping them capitalize on their expertise and move up the value chain. Let’s take a look at what Dharavi Diary is doing.', 'This time The Better India team got a brilliant opportunity to visit the well-known Dharavi community through a remarkable initiative of Dharavi Diary group. The project started with a bunch of youngsters with a will to make a difference through their creativity. Mr Nawneet Ranjan, a social entrepreneur and a filmmaker along with his crew started working on a documentary “Dharavi Diary” to dwell deep into their lives and to understand their needs, their struggles, their happiness and the way they live. Dharavi is Asia’s largest slum with over one million people packed into a labyrinth of dark alleys. Numerous movies have been made on Dharavi in the past but this group decided to take their project to the next level and extend the idea of story telling to Slum Innovation.', 'The rather infamous Dharavi is the green heart of the great city of Mumbai wherein majorities of the people in the slum have created an identity by making this place a recycling hub. With the increasing consumerism, there is a huge generation of waste such as plastics, glass and metals throughout the city as well as around the country. This community then picks and sorts these unwanted materials to be later sold to scrap dealers for processing in order to be re-used. They have found a way to sustain themselves and earn a living with dignity, besides having created an industry and being spoken of as Dharavi’s Recycle Miracle.', 'However, Mr. Nawneet points out, “These people in the slum generally work for few Recycle Workshop Owners, who are not slum dwellers. They work at the grass root level but are paid minimal amounts for their services and do not gain much. We want them to be more independent and enhance their skills, by assisting them in their transformation from rag-pickers and sorters to product makers. We are working towards making their inclusive development successful”. Dharavi Diary team is making this possible by means of various projects namely Dharavi Recycling School, Feature Documentary, Cross Platform Story-Telling, Games, Interactive Slum Walk and Webisodes.', 'As part of Dharavi Recycling School, they are conducting workshops to train the people in the Dharavi community. On 6th and 7th of January, they conducted a workshop on Making Accessories from discarded old/waste/scrap clothes. Two ladies, Meritar and Pia from Finland came to train the women workforce from Dharavi and at the end of two eventful days, they were successful in making handbags, laptop bags, small purses etc. The ability to master the skills in such a short duration of time was amazing – the quality, design and manufacture of the bags was actually in competition with the products sold around the world. Similar workshops are being conducted and they are experimenting with different product groups.', 'In parallel, a feature documentary is being made on the whole process of development. Mr. Nawneet says, “We want to document the entire process of transformation in the sorter’s life and also serve as a model for other bottom-up community initiatives in slums around the world”. Along the same lines, cross-platform story telling, slum walk and games will enable them to take people across the slum and create respect, awareness and empathy towards the whole community. Deepti Ravi, a gaming professional is working with the kids and organizing story-telling campaigns to seed their imagination and also get their ideas and perspective. These are the sessions on Learn Unlearn and Create.', 'But, what motivates them? Where do they find their inspiration from? Vidhu Chandan who is the Photographer and Producer in Dharavi Diary says:', 'We want to change the perception of Dharavi. This place is full of self-sufficient people who have created a job opportunity of their own on their own without any help from any Organization, Government and are not in any way a burden on society. In fact they are responsible for cleaning the country’s waste and generating revenue. They have been trying on their own to uplift their community, by earning and sending their children to schools, and improving their living conditions. We are just trying to enhance their skills and promote the positivity in the community and boost their integrity and strength.', 'Lakshmi, a Dharavi dweller, called Lakshmi Tai by all the children around, is a very active participant in all the initiatives and says, “If you want to live in this world, then you better become a fighter, only then will you succeed”. Such is the spirit of these people that you get reminded of what Martin Luther King Jr. had once said “If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the host of heaven and earth will pause to say, here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well”. Such is the admirable pride and dignity people in this community have for themselves and their work.', 'Their short film has been screened at many International Film Festivals around the world such as Nat Geo All Roads Film Festival, Epidemic Film Festival and Social Film Festival. Dharavi Diary team is also trying to collaborate with organizations such as itokri, remake.fi and others to enable selling of the products made by the people in Dharavi. The Dharavi Diary team says, “Dharavi Diary is a ‘slum innovation’ project fusing entrepreneurship and storytelling. The basic premise is that people in poverty practice jugaad out of necessity, so we want to enable more entrepreneurs in poor communities by developing their jugaad skills so they may improve their income opportunities”.', 'Note: Dharavi Diary team is an active contestant in Spark the Rise initiative by Mahindra. As a part of this unique platform, projects need to attain maximum votes and present their project plan to a jury. This motivated, full-of-life team says, “If you like our work, please do vote for us. Give a missed call on 022 – 61850654 and YOUR VOTE will be counted or visit the page and like us.

His diligence of time didn’t surprise me much though, for having been a student of Mumbai’s St Xavier’s College, all I’d seen of Dr Sam was him pacing hurriedly through the campus, hands always with notes, students always in tow.', 'Although he warns me to not give him any ‘cult’ treatment through the interview and even refuses to pose for a picture, it’s true that his leadership and restless attitude have seen XRCVC become one of India’s premier institutions in the visually impaired sector and its training, infrastructure and advocacy have impacted several blind and sighted people.', 'Dr Sam’s room, preceded by swanky ‘special’ computers, gives away his centre’s position through numerous accolades. There are also stacks of printed material all over, perhaps an effect of the Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2012 which was passed in May last year, enabling those with visual impairment and other print disabilities to convert any book into Braille, audio and other formats without the publishers’ permission. “We’ve now got the freedom to create accessible copies (of books/material) without being seen as doing something illegal,” he tells me, later admitting that the Act legalised what the centre was doing any way to cater to needs of blind students. “But now we are at par with a large number of countries which have this law,” he adds.', 'With 40 million persons with print disabilities in India, it’s the most visible disability with a higher amount of awareness and infrastructure as compared to others. Does he see a ‘have-nots’ feeling among others in the sector, we ask, stopping short of the word ‘envy’. “The Copyright Amendment wasn’t only for the blind, it says ‘persons with disability.’ Besides, all our other work is for the blind but will benefit all persons with disability.”', 'He convinced us how accessibility reforms for blind persons will also bring about the same for those with other disabilities. For instance, one of XRCVC’s recent victories has been getting Union Bank to make talking ATMs which are accessible to persons with visual impairment, which will in turn also enable wheelchair accessibility. SBI too should reportedly follow suit, which will be an even bigger achievement. Dr Sam’s ‘keep knocking’ attitude goes a long way in keeping the centre’s battles persistent with governments and private bodies. “In the end, we’re working for accessibility. Whether it’s in education or universal design… there’s lots to be done, and we’re a very small team,” he feels.', 'The team has however ensured the centre is technologically one of the country’s most well equipped centres for the visually challenged. “The facilities – whether they’re screen readers or OCRs (which scan/edit/read aloud printed material) or refreshable Braille machines – are of international standards,” he beams and it’s true, I’ve seen the centre constantly evolve with shinier, smarter machines.', 'In fact, such is the tech prowess of XRCVC that even the Hellen Keller Institute for the Deaf-Blind had sent students for a training module that week. It’s E-library and assistive technology-aided content make it a popular hive for knowledge-hungry students with disabilities not only from Xavier’s but all over the city. Besides, I remember the centre organizing cricket matches for its members, which not only sensitized other college students, but also gave an energetic buzz to its image.', 'While asking about one of the machines, we’re curtly reminded of the limited time on hand. “You may have a look after I leave because now you have precisely (checks his watch) three minutes,” Dr Sam puts it straight. We make the most of it by asking him a personal question, ‘what keeps him going?’ as a teacher (Dr Sam is the HOD of the Sociology Dept and has been teaching since 1988). “The activism and advocacy are voluntary, whereas teaching and interacting with the young keeps me going. I get the energy from both!” he admits.', 'At 10.25, as the force behind XRCVC rushes out for another meeting, giving many instructions to his subordinates in the room, we only wonder if there’s yet another secret source of his energy and infectious enthusiasm.

What can they have in common? They are all social and ecological entrepreneurs, and this is how they are making a difference.', 'The city-residents have chosen cleaner, healthier and less environmentally-impacting lives. The villager and the forest dweller seek a similar choice – from their customers. The villager meets a basic, feminine need while the honey hunter wants to convey the knowledge that his livelihood is entwined with the health of the forest (and of the honey bee colonies).', 'Back to Basics – Eco Femme\nEver wondered what impact menstrual hygiene has on the environment? All those disposable sanitary pads used and thrown away every month. Can women adapt to healthy, affordable menstrual practices that are also eco-positive?', 'Eleven women in Auroville, Puduchery, are trying to prove just that. They make up Eco Femme, a womens’ empowerment and self-help group, that stitches and sells washable cloth-based sanitary pads. The group’s output is 1,600 pads a month – mostly sent to the UK, the US and the Netherlands. Now Eco Femme is trying to expand within India.', 'Founder Kathy Walkling, a long-time Auroville resident, started by designing, using and selling washable pads at Auroville. She says a single, washable cloth pad represents the equivalent of 120 disposable tampons/pads used over a five-year period. “A UK survey showed that a woman throws away approx 125-150kg of sanitary waste during her menstruating life which is assumed to be 35 years,” she explains. In the Indian context there are no surveys. “But a survey in the Indian Textile Journal on the market potential of disposable sanitary napkins says there are over 300 million women of menstruating age in India. The article says if all of them used sanitary napkins, it would result in sales of (and consequently waste from!) 58,500 million pieces a year!” she rues.', 'Tackling Taboos\nEco Femme was born in 2009 when Kathy involved women self-help group members of the Auroville Village Action Group (AVAG)–an NGO which runs various social enterprises in the villages around Auroville. Now, they organise educational workshops to address the many taboos and gender-based stereotypes associated with menstruation – being considered ‘impure’, becoming a social outcast on those days, and so on. Plus, the project aims to get women to use cloth again. Currently, three models of pads designed for rural women are being product tested with over 1,000 rural women and girls across Tamil Nadu. For urban women, Eco Femme has an ‘export’ or international range of all-in-one pads with wings and leakproof layer, adapted from brands available in the West.', 'Eco Femme pads, adds Walkling, help women save money (a washable pad can last years) and the environment.', 'For further details: www.villageaction.in\nwww.ecofemme.org', '———————————————————————————————————————-\nKeeping the Last Forests Alive – Last Forests\nHalan from Baviyoor village is a honey collector or hunter.

This initative, promoted by the Kotagiri, Tamil Nadu-based Keystone Foundation (KF), aims to provide a livelihood for tribal people while protecting and conserving the NBR forests.', 'Suganthi Thangavelu, marketing specialist with Last Forest, says KF involves tribal communities in areas such as natural resource management (promoting beekeeping or apiculture, for example) and enterprise management (production of food, craft and artisanal products). The Last Forest brand offers nine categories of organic/fair-trade and natural products – from varieties of honey (raw, bitter, wild, ginger, etc.) to spices, coffee and oils, personal care products and even, home accessories (Kurumba craft work). “Presently, we work with over a 1,000 individuals (honey collectors, craftsmen, farmers, etc),” she says. The biggest benefit to them, she explains, is that they get upfront cash payment and assured purchase of the quantities they produce.', 'These products are available at Last Forest-owned Green Shops located at Ooty, Kotagiri, Coonoor and Mysore, as well as other stores in Mumbai, Delhi, Pune and Pondichery.', 'Under Threat\nBut beyond the exotic allure of the brand, lies a grim truth – the NBR forests, spread over Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, are under threat, says KF. On one hand there are human activities such as tourism, poaching, logging and extraction of medicinal plants; on the other, there is climate change. Now, the bees are getting affected too. In fact, a May 2011 report in The Hindu noted that bees in the Western Ghats are abandoning their colonies, leading to a sharp decline in honey production.', 'So, the Last Forest brand is not just about “buying organic”, it is about investing in the forests and the indigenous communities.

Launched in 2006, Daily Dump operates on an ‘open source’ platform–others can “clone” the concept. “There are 15 other clones” operating presently in the country. There’s also a franchisee in Chile.', 'Waste gone waste?\nAs of August 2012, Daily Dump users were responsible for keeping over 7,000 kgs of organic waste out of landfills. At Sarovar Apartments alone, four big composters handle 10 kgs of organic/kitchen waste daily. Yet so much more can be done in waste management. According to Poonam, research shows Bangalore generates upto 4,500 tonnes of waste every day. “Sixty per cent of that is organic,” she stresses. To show people what happens to their trash, Daily Dump conducts (based on enquiries received) day-long tours called Trash Trails. The trip includes interactions with small scale entrepreneurs, recyclers, sorters and dealers.', 'Poonam has also recently launched Recycle Guru–a website to bring citizens closer to their local recycler. “Log onto Recycle Guru, get the number of your local raddiwala/kabadiwalla, and call him to pick up your waste,” says Poonam.

In Part 1, we present two of them.', 'Schooling them to be water-wise\nThe former techie now into rain water harvesting (RWH) is Avinash Krishnamurthy, executive director of Biome Environmental, a Bangalore-based non governmental organisation (NGO). Over the past year, Biome has installed, and in some cases revived (existing), RWH systems in eight government schools around Bangalore. Located in water-stressed regions, the schools depend on panchayat water. Supply is either erratic or non-existent. So, there is no safe water for cooking (the mid-day meal), washing vessels or even, for use in the toilets.', 'Yet from 2005, the Government of Karnataka has spent over Rs 77 crore on a Suvarna Jala scheme to install rooftop RWH systems in more than 23,000 schools in the state. Krishnamurthy says the scheme is not working. “At the individual school level, faculty are not involved in the system upkeep, there is no protocol for testing water quality. In some cases, the schools don’t even need RWH systems,” he explains.', 'So far, Biome has spent Rs 7 lakh on the project. Local support and knowledge is crucial to their success. For instance, Ramakrishnappa from Kuruburakunte near Devanahalli, a local, helps the NGO identify schools with the worst water shortage. Given that there is also increasing water contamination, Biome wants to provide testing kits so students can test for fluorides and nitrates in the water. “Children can then monitor water quality in their villages,” says Krishnamurthy. For instance, at the Government Urdu School in Vijayapura, some 40 km from Bangalore, Biome spent Rs 11,000 to revive the school’s defunct RWH system. The NGO also showed teachers and the school’s 60-odd students how to maintain the RWH system.', 'Things are already changing. In August, there were good rains. And Nageena, a class seven student, is happy. “We can use the toilets now,” she laughs.', 'Eat. Grow. Live\nIn the mid 1990s, a gardening enthusiast went public with his passion. Grow greens on your terraces and your balconies, he urged his fellow Bangaloreans. Not many listened. Bangalore was a sleepy city of sprawling bungalows and well-tended gardens then. As the city grew and space became measured in square feet, what Dr B N Vishwanath said all those years ago finally made sense.', 'Today, the agriculturist is considered one of the pioneers of urban farming in India. Founding trustee of the Garden City Farmers Trust (GCFT), his message is the same – “eat what you can grow in your garden” or Oota from your Thota (OfyT). Dr Vishwanath explains:', 'At organic gardening workshops, we tell participants to set up RWH systems and convert their kitchen waste into compost. That reduces their carbon footprint. We tell them to buy seeds for the first time and thereafter, to grow their own.', 'Now, seeds of interest in OfyT are being sown in neighbouring cities such as Chennai, Hyderabad and Thiruvanathapuram.', 'Bangalore being IT city, OfyT is growing thanks to innumerable blogs, websites and the GCFT Facebook page.

They are also the lifeline of people in the region – their only means of connection with the outside world, and with each other! While admiring their beauty, Gangadharan is privy to the important role they play in people’s lives, while getting a chance to explore magical islands.', 'There’s a poem in Malayalam that describes the serene beauty of Kerala. It roughly translates as: ‘She has her head resting on the lush green pillows of the Sahyadris, and her feet resting on the shores of the Arabian Sea, and her immaculate body is adorned with the ornaments of the backwaters.’', 'These ornaments criss-cross the entire stretch of the Malabar, from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasargod, and measure over 900 kilometres in its undulating length! It’s a blue-green labyrinth made of canals, lakes and rivers. The most picturesque of them is in the Southern part of Kerala and spreads over four districts: Ernakulam, Alappuzha, Kottayam and Kollam. It comprises five large lakes interlinked by canals, and breast-fed by 38 rivers.', 'Says Manu Menon, a naturalist and wildlife photographer based in Kerala, ‘Due to the dynamic nature of these waterbodies where sea water and sweet water continuously mingle with each other, a unique eco-system is created. Here a wide spectrum of flora and fauna, of both the sea and the sweet water variety, have been living in harmony for millennia’.', 'Adjoining these backwaters is another habitat called Kol Wetlands that’s unique to Kerala. The major ones being in Parappur, Vembanad and Ashtamudi. Much like it happens in Kachchh in Gujarat, large swathes of land near the backwaters get completely submerged in water during the monsoon, creating innumerable islands. When the water drains off from here after the monsoon, they once again become flatlands where paddy is cultivated from October to March. As many as four species of migratory fish have been recorded in the Kol wetlands, and they have been declared as Ramsar sites for their international ecological significance.', 'Just as there are National Highways in the rest of India, there are National Waterways in Kerala! The longest of them is National Waterway No.3 that runs from Kollam to Kottappuram for a marathon distance of 205 kms.', 'I had done the highway four years ago. We had stayed on a Kettuvallam or a Houseboat for a night and two days, at the ever-popular Kumarakom. I still remember sleeping on the deck under a canopy of twinkling stars. Much before that, I had spent a night at deep sea, near Bhayander in Mumbai. And the difference between the two nights was dramatic.\xa0Though it’s the same canopy of stars that you sleep under in the deep sea, the wobbly fishing boat makes you feel insecure, and with no land in sight anywhere you feel like a speck in the infinite universe, totally at the mercy of the elements. But in a Houseboat in the backwaters, you are the centre of the universe, safely cocooned in the orchards of swaying coconut palms.', 'This time, I decided to stay away from the National Waterways and take a small by-lane instead. My search for uncharted waters took me to the backwaters of Murinjapuzha, which literally means the Sliced River. A tributary of Moovattupuzha, it’s 25 kms long as the duck swims.', 'At the ‘tea-shaap’, as I was sipping tea and nibbling at a parippu-vada (or dal-vada for the uninitiated), the President of the local Panchayat, Selvan, said, ‘Saar, what you have done is right. It is high time tourists leave Kumarakom and Allapuzha, and explore these virgin waterways instead.’ And true to his words, in the amazing waterways of Murinjapuzha there was no traffic jam of Houseboats. The channel was being criss-crossed only by small country boats and smaller canoes.', 'This island is just one of the over hundred islands that dot these untested backwaters, spread over 20 sq kms. The smallest of them is just a few acres, and uninhabited; and the largest is around 3 sq kms with over 1700 houses, including churches, temples, schools and hospitals!', 'It’s a world interconnected only with waterways and a boat is the only mode of transport. So you go to school by boat, you go to work by boat, you go to the market by boat, and of course you visit your neighbours’ house by boat. So each house has a parking lot for the boats, and everyone in the house, men, women and children, are adept at rowing to their destination.', 'Anju Jose was the man who introduced me to this amazing waterworld. Unlike the huge, luxurious Kettuvallams or House Boats that can be moored only in deep water, and are therefore kept at a respectable distance from the shores, Anju’s boat could approach the land at will. Whenever the water became shallow, he would quietly dismantle the motor and fish out the huge bamboo pole for rowing closer to the land.', 'Thus we touched base at many places in the three large islands of Poothotta, Chempu and Murinjapuzha, and many more tiny ones.', 'In all the smaller islands, there was a peculiar problem: ‘Water, water, everywhere; not a drop to drink!’ Because, though surrounded by an abundant quantity of brackish water, there are no sweet-water sources on these islands. So the water available on the islands is used only for bathing, washing vessels and washing clothes. And in one of these islands, I saw the paradoxical sight of water being transported on water!', 'There was a whole new world out there waiting to be explored. And standing on the hull of the boat, I felt the same thrill as Ibn Batuta, the Chinese Traveller, and Marco Polo, the Legendary Explorer, both of whom had been here many centuries ago. First, there was the Magic Island, where not even the smallest canoe could approach, as the water was only one foot deep all around, for a radius of half a kilometre! So you had to wade through knee-deep water for 15 minutes to reach there. Then there was this necklace of islands each of which had chosen its occupation. So there were islands that had poultry farms, duck farms, banana plantations, prawn farms, Chinese fishing nets, toddy-tapping, sand-dredging, shell-meat collection, lime production and coir-making.', 'I met an old lady on Chempu Island who was weaving magic with her hands. Using a small, wooden contraption, she was getting unruly strands of coconut fibre to form a small rope, and was then getting two such small ropes to merge into one, just like two entwined serpents.', 'Just as our country boat took a U-turn, I looked back at the serpentine waterways that stretched as far as the eyes could see, and experienced the inexplicable joy of taking the path less traveled.', 'Gangadharan Menon is a nature writer, art teacher, and photographer of the wild.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

More interestingly, he is a Muslim who does masterful Hebrew calligraphy.', 'While studying in madrasa, he learned that the Jewish people were considered by Islam to be ahl al-kitab (“People of the Book”), which sparked a curiosity in him to learn more about this religious community. His curiosity led him to find a copy of the Gideon’s Bible, which had a page with prayers in 23 different languages. He decided to find what encompassed the Hebrew word for God, so using the page as his “Rosetta Stone” he was able to decipher what letters entailed the Hebrew name for the Lord.', 'Thoufeek became more interested in Judaism and Hebrew calligraphy, and reached out to the tiny yet historic Jewish community in Cochin. Thoufeek purchased some Hebrew texts he found at a streetside book shop and he went about learning the Hebrew alphabet. His studies in Hebrew led him to begin crafting calligraphy of Jewish prayers such as the Birkat haBayit (prayer for the home) in golden resplendent brilliance.', 'Thofeek even began creating calligraphic replicas of the Torah.', 'More importantly, Thoufeek does something very unique: he has crafted Hebrew calligraphy in the ancient Kufic Arabic script. Such work is a rarity in the calligraphic world, and his innovations in the Kufic/Hebrew calligraphy has brought Thoufeek accolades from admirers from all over the world. Zakriya has been commissioned as far away as Ukraine and the United States to create works that combine Arabic calligraphy with Jewish prayers.', 'Thoufeek’s work and his dedication to study Jewish history and culture led to a close friendship between him and Cochin’s Jewish community, including his warm friendship with the community’s matriarch Sarah Cohen. Cohen has hosted Thoufeek for Passover seders and other Jewish holiday celebrations.', 'I met Thoufeek at Sarah Cohen’s embroidery shop, where she stitches yarmulkes and other Jewish-Indian embroideries. As we sat sipping tea and eating watermelon squares and black helwa (sweets), she remarked that she considers him to be like a grandson and a real mensch.', 'Thoufeek Zakriya is a wonderful symbol of India’s legendary tolerance for religious communities. “At a time when Jews and Muslims are sadly seen as natural adversaries, Thoufeek’s Hebrew calligraphy emerges as yet another example of Muslim-Jewish amity from India,” says Dr. Navras Aafreedi, an Assistant Professor in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Gautam Buddha University. Professor Aafreedi studies Jewish communities of India, and noted that Zakriya is the only known Muslim Hebrew calligrapher in India.', '“Thoufeek’s work shows us that the way to peace is through the exploration of each other’s culture and the commonalities between them,” says Dr. Aafreedi, “His work is a reminder of the shared cultural and religious heritage of Jews and Muslims, which definitely needs to be brought into sharper focus in such a manner that it overshadows the disputes, conflicts and differences.”', 'Photographs courtesy: Paul Rockower & Thoufeek Zakariya', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
