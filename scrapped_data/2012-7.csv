Helplessness because we do not know how we can assist them in improving their lives. But there is one among us, Richard D’Silva, who has overcome this feeling of helplessness and found ways to aid destitute people in getting them what they need – medical aid, rehabilitation or suitable employment. We hope many more will join in his brave efforts.', 'It is a regular monsoon afternoon in Mumbai and Ajit is lying down under one of the flyovers of Eastern Express Highway. A 20-something guy walks past him, just like every other person. Few minutes later, he comes back to Ajit, talks to him for a while and detects a bad odour. He then notices his foot and sees the bones. He realizes that Ajit’s foot is infected and the infection is eating away his flesh. He inspects the legs further to see worms in action. He calls up one of the NGOs (Intermission) working for destitute people. In few days, with the help of the NGO and one of his close friends, Ajit is picked up from his place and is taken to J J Hospital where he is currently receiving treatment with his leg amputated to prevent infection from spreading into the rest of the body.', 'Few weeks later, that 20-something guy meets me in one of the cafés in Powai, explaining his fight against destitution in the country. For the next one and half hours, he walks me through his one and half years of journey with the destitutes in Mumbai, mainly eastern suburban Mumbai. Meet Richard D’Silva. Ajit, one of the 78 million homeless in India, is one among the many homeless in Mumbai who have been fortunate enough to find a helping hand in Richard, been picked up from the footpath and moved to their rightful place – a hospital or an old age home or somewhere where they could find work and earn their bread. As he explains why he is doing what he is doing, ideas are presented, questions are asked, concerns are raised and hope is expressed.', 'Currently studying Civil Engineering, Richard takes his inspiration from Jesus Christ. His battle against homelessness began in early 2011 when he saw a very old man lying on the streets of Goadbundar road, Thane, disowned by his family. While he had seen many homeless before, this time the inspiration to do something for them overpowered societal fear. With the help of police, an NGO and his close friend Tushar James, who has helped Richard many times in his initiative, Richard arranged rehabilitation for the old man. However, as destiny would have decided, the homeless man withdrew at the last moment. Even after a lot of persuasion he refused, to which Richard had to heed. However, an unsuccessful experience on the first attempt itself did not deter Richard from his desire to do something for the destitute, whom he had been seeing since his childhood.', 'Over the last one and half years, Richard has been working to rehabilitate several impoverished persons and has, in fact, improved the lives of many. Poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, illness, drug addiction, alcoholism, family disownment and many such reasons are leading to an increase in the number of homeless in this country every year. Lack of political will to do something for them is resulting in many of them losing their lives due to various reasons, particularly climate extremities in winters, summers and monsoons.', 'While the government attitude is certainly not encouraging, a greater concern is the public mind-set for the homeless.', 'People do not go out to help them but instead, frown upon them even when these destitute have done no harm to anybody. Station masters (at suburban railways stations) themselves tell that commuters call them to throw these people away from stations. They have to do that as well.', 'says Richard. This, in spite of the fact that an average commuter does not spend more than 5 minutes in a day in a station. These homeless are either thrown outside or put in any train and destiny takes care of the rest. Though very inhuman, this is a reality.', 'These are also the realities that have kept Richard motivated in his mission. His small team identifies the homeless who are in need of immediate attention – either rehabilitation or medical treatment. In case of medical treatment, the needy person is shifted to the nearest government hospital as government hospitals are obliged to treat homeless free of cost. Although not all government hospitals follow these guidelines religiously, there are certain exceptions like J J Hospital and Nair Hospital where Richard has been able to get maximum number of homeless treated. In case of rehabilitation, the person is sent to a suitable location – an old age home or a place where he/she can find work.', 'However, sometimes, the homeless person refuses to co-operate. The problem becomes specifically acute with drug addicts. From adults to kids (as young as 8-10 years old), addiction of alcohol, smoking and even whiteners (which is fatal as well) lead these people to have no apparent interest in life but to beg, earn money and spend it on drugs. In addition, there are also the destitute who have lost complete interest in life so much so that they willfully try to kill themselves even while receiving treatment in hospital.', 'Professional Help\nWhile Richard and his small group of friends have been active in rehabilitating the destitute for some time now, lack of professional guidance has been one of the major obstacle in achieving the desired results. The Police does help in providing some necessary support, but if anything happens to the homeless then the person who brought the homeless is supposed to take care of everything that happens after that! NGOs that have helped till date are focused towards other social evils because of which the extent of help is restricted.', 'Guidance and active help from NGOs who specialize in rehabilitating the homeless would solve multiple problems. While providing better rehabilitation to these homeless, it will also help deal with the police and hospital authorities in a better manner. Today, many hospital authorities refuse to accept our requests since we neither have any valid social ID card nor we are related to the homeless in any manner.', 'Infrastructure and Resources\nIn addition to lack of professional help, lack of proper infrastructure and resources is another concern that prevents rehabilitation of the homeless. With no apparent guidelines, lack of proper shelter homes especially during climatic extremities, lack of will in government hospital staff to treat the destitute and many other issues, a lot needs to be done. Also, creating more employment opportunities in rural areas will reduce the burden on cities to provide these people with employment. A majority of homeless in cities are the villagers who come to cities with hopes of getting a job and sending money back home so that their financial situation improves. With less education and employability, they do not find jobs but they also cannot go back to village due to societal pressures.', 'Scaling Up\nWith social and academic responsibilities, it becomes difficult, at times, to devote adequate time to the initiative. Going ahead, Richard expects to rope in more people into the initiative. Till date, help from Tushar has been significant as he has accompanied Richard many times and has even filled the void for Richard when he is not available due to other commitments. Increase in the number of people joining the initiative will increase the number of homeless they are able to rehabilitate. For this, people will need to invest some time in knowing these homeless and understanding their concerns. This is necessary to change the mind set and public attitude towards destitutes.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
1,2012-7,"['Archives', 'TBI Travel: Sualkuchi – Weaving “Responsible” Dreams']","['\n\n\nby\n\nMeena Vaidyanathan\n\n\nJuly 26, 2012, 10:24 am \n\n\n', 'As our hearts and prayers go out to the unfortunate people in Assam facing the brunt of turbulent times, we take a look at one of the state’s indigenous arts that is both beautiful and innovative. Meena Vaidyanathan visits Sualkuchi, a weavers’ village where silk is made differently and humanely, and discovers little-known facets of the Assamese way of life that leaves her with a new-found respect for the hardy and self-sufficient people.', 'What do you call silk that is made without boiling live silkworm pupae? Responsible silk? Non-violent (Ahimsa) silk? Whatever you want to name it – it is gorgeous and it is weaved in one small district of Assam called Sualkuchi. As I discover more of Assam, I get more intrigued and mesmerised. A state with 22 million population of which a large number of households have a loom where they weave their own cloth. But almost all of the silk weaving is done in Sualkuchi. When I set off one fine morning to spend a day with the weavers to understand their life a little better, I didn’t realise it would lead to this unending thirst to learn more.', 'Assam is the home of several types of silks, the most prominent being Muga, the gold-hued silk found exclusively in this state. Other silks include Pat and Eri or Endi, of which all silks except Pat is non-mulberry silk. The worms mainly feed on castor leaves and only the open ended cocoons are used for turning into silk.', 'As I walked into a traditional loom, I saw a mid-aged woman deftly moving her feet and hands in a coordinated manner to weave a beautiful design into the sari. The designs, determined by a very digital-looking cardboard rectangle, looked so obscure that it was hard to believe that the simple punched holes would give rise to the most amazing patterns in silk. Miri, as the lady was called, told me that she, like most other weavers in the region, came from a place called Mangaldoi and lived in rented huts in Sualkuchi. She took about 6-8 days, depending on the complexity of the design, to weave one sari, and earned about Rs. 100 a day! I also learnt that nearly 60% of the women weavers who brought to life the silks made in Assam lived outside of the district.', 'The owner of the loom told me that the weavers get a 2-hour break during the day where they feed their families lunch and also get time for a nap. I didn’t quite trust him, but most of the women I spoke to seemed to echo his lines, which made me believe that the lives of these weavers was perhaps a shade better than many contracted weavers in other parts of India. Perhaps the reason has been that the much of the weaving is done through a network of co-operatives.', 'To a large number of the weavers, not just in Sualkuchi but all over Assam, this cottage industry had been a way of life rather than mere source of living. Which perhaps explains the fact that weaving in Assam isn’t restricted to certain communities or tribes alone but spread across caste and class lines. I heard a wonderful story where Momai Tamuli Barbarua, a minister of king Pratap Singha, made it compulsory for every adult able bodied female in Assam to spin a certain quantity of yarn every evening! I was also told that in a marriage proposal, proficiency of the would-be bride in Bowa-kata,i.e.,skill in spinning and weaving is ranked way above her skills in cooking! It is still customary among the Assamese, that on the occasion of Bihu, a grown-up girl makes presents of self-woven Bihuan (Phulam Gamosa) to her near and dear ones as a token of love and respect. It was fascinating to learn that women not just dominated in weaving the silks but in districts of Goalpara, where a lot of silkworm rearing is done, it’s the Rabha women who take the lead.', 'Which Miri also did with fine finesse. The Muga silk she was weaving had a golden sheen that she told me grows more lustrous with each wash. This was used, together with zari, to weave fabrics for royalty. Today, the zari has been replaced by multicoloured cotton threads. The designs woven into these fabrics are drawn from the flora of Assam and, as in other parts of India, are symbolic of the different tribes and ethnic groups of the area. One speciality of this region is the bamboo weft designs, eight in number, which are used as variations in weaving patterns.', 'I learnt that as many as twelve types of looms are said to be in use in the state which may be broadly grouped into the Throw Shuttle Loom, Lion Loom, Pit Loom and Fly Shuttle Loom. The first one is found in almost every Assamese household while the second one is in common use among the hill tribes. Migrant weavers from Bangladesh mostly use Pit Loom. The Fly Shuttle loom which is a recent introduction is an improved type of frame which considerably increases the output of the weavers. Of the more than 17 lakh people in Assam involved in the handloom sector, silk production and weaving provides employment to over 54,000 families in Assam.', 'As demand and popularity rises, I also saw many looms using cheaper silk yarn sourced from states like Karnataka that are coloured to weave the designs into the muga and pat silks. This brings down the cost of production and therefore results in an increase in sales of relatively cheaper priced silk sarees and mekhalas. I tried to cloak my disappointment with this by acknowledging the fact that lower priced sarees, even if they weren’t all locally sourced, would increase the popularity of this fine piece of art, which in turn can only help the lovely women of Assam gain more employment.', 'As I walked towards the market from the village where I spent the day, I realized there were more than 80 stores in that narrow lane alone. And there were many such lanes in Sualkuchi, where the saree stores competed for space with the zillion Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesh temples. I bought a silk saree, very similar to the one Miri was weaving and as I walked back to my car, I couldn’t help smiling at the thought of the many dreams she was weaving in the designs every day!', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
2,2012-7,"['Archives', 'Dairy Diaries Of Hardy Hill Women – How Being Able To Afford Cows Turned Their Lives Around']","['\n\n\nby\n\nNitin Jugran Bahuguna\n\n\nJuly 23, 2012, 10:44 am \n\n\n', 'Patma Devi Rana watches with satisfaction as her four sons, between eight to 16 years old, eat their breakfast of ‘paranthas’ (Indian layered bread) and wash it down with tumblers of cool milk before heading for school. It’s just another day in the hectic life of this 35-year-old woman hailing from Bajlari village in Uttarkashi district of the hill state of Uttarakhand – but there’s a difference.', 'Today, she can ensure that her children have a well-balanced diet replete with adequate calcium, a far cry from her situation a couple of years back when milk was scarce and too costly to procure. Going to the root of the problem, Patma organised a group of women in her village and launched a dairy initiative, which has not only improved the health of her children and others but has given the women ample income generating power to enhance their lives. She recalls, “Around two years ago, nine of us got together and decided to form a self help group (SHG). We thought it would be useful to start some activity, which could give us income. Now we are all members of Anchal Dairy, a major milk supplying company in the state.”', 'Anchal Dairy was started with the help of the Himalayan Action Research Centre (HARC), a Dehradun-based NGO. A total of 40 women from four villages – Bajlari, Pamadi, Nariyumka and Manda – are involved in dairy production. “From our village, 16 women, including our SHG members, have joined Anchal Dairy,” informs Patma.', 'Explaining how they began the dairy work, Patma says they took a loan from the local bank, facilitated by HARC.', 'Initially, the bank gave us a trial loan of Rs 15,000 each, on the condition that we would be given more if we repaid this amount within the stipulated time. We returned Rs 1,000 every month for 15 months. Eight of the members availed of the loan and each bought a cow from the entire loan amount.', 'They took another loan in January 2011, this time of Rs 30,000. Once again, each woman bought a cow. “My first cow gave about eight kilos of milk in a day. Of this, three kilos was consumed by my family and I sold five kilos at Rs 18-20 per kilo,” states Patma.', 'Fellow SHG member Sarda Devi, 29, is an equally satisfied dairy entrepreneur. “For women like me who have had no prior source of income, the money I make from selling milk comes in very handy for household expenses like buying medicines, home repairs, children’s school fees and clothes,” she explains.', 'Another happy dairy farmer is Amma Devi, 35, who claims to have adequate milk to feed her five children and enough left over to sell. Amma has also used a portion of her profits to get her cow artificially inseminated. “I spent Rs 1,200 to get one of my cows artificially inseminated at the veterinary hospital in Naugaon. The doctor’s fee was Rs 200 but the cost of transporting the cow to the hospital and back cost Rs 1,000,” she says. Undaunted, Amma feels it is a worthwhile investment once the calf is delivered, as there will be more milk production in the future.', 'The dairy initiative is part of HARC’s programme to create alternate employment avenues for rural women farmers who, over the years, have been adversely affected by climate change that has seen them getting poorer yields from their land. In 2011, the NGO helped create opportunities for rural women in the district to own micro enterprises by setting up nine groups – four for dairy business, two for floriculture, two groups for stitching and knitting and one group for handicraft activity. Observes HARC’s founder Mahendra Singh Kunwar, “We found that women had a low status within their communities and a low level of awareness, while the men had control over the cash.” Therefore, they decided to focus on organising and strengthening women’s groups through rigorous capacity building training in group management, conflict resolution, decision-making, financial management, micro enterprise development and marketing skills. The women were given training at different processing units set up at accessible places and were shown the benefits of an activity if managed collectively.', 'Two trainings were organised during January-February 2011 for women of five villages to start dairy micro enterprises. They were given training in livestock management and also learnt how to prepare proposals, which were then submitted to NABARD. Once these were cleared, the State Bank of India sanctioned loans for the purchase of cows/buffaloes, says HARC activist Amita Kala, 32. “A simple thing like going to the bank was a first for many of them. Today, they stride in confidently to transact their business,” she observes.', 'A recent HARC survey, based on interviews with 196 women, indicates that women’s access to loans was made easy when they applied for group loans at banks. The data also shows that women’s increased access to loans has made their economic contribution visible at the household level. Now, they are contributing to different economic activities of the family such as the construction of houses, the marriage of children, the opening of shop for children or spouses, health care, and the education of children. They also invest in their own income generation activities.', '“We are happy today. Earlier, when we worked at cutting grass, we were unable to make any money,” remarks Patma. “Now, with my cows producing milk for at least ten months of the year, I make a profit of between Rs 5,000-6,000 a month. Moreover, my children are getting good nourishment and we even utilise the dung from the cows as fertilizer,” she discloses with a smile.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Our social and cultural variety is not only visible in the multiple languages spoken, the many faiths that are practised but also in the innumerable arts and crafts of the country. Artisans in each state or region of this vast land have been linked with their unique traditional paintings, sculpture, pottery, weaving, embroidery or printing. They have been producing these works from one or more materials like metal, wood, clay, bamboo, stone or thread for generations. It is important to note that the handiwork is often their only source of livelihood. Although the work does not fetch enough returns and the government does not support most of them through subsidies or incentives, they continue to practice their craft. This is because the knowledge is passed on to them through their family elders and they have been on the job from a young age. Further, they do not possess other skills.

But this learning does not get you a lucrative job. Instead, it equips you with sensitivity and understanding towards the visually impaired. In an entertaining way, it immerses you in the world of the unseen, and lets you explore your feelings and thoughts.', 'Have you ever wondered what it is like to be blind? How do the visually impaired perform their daily chores, how do they find their way around, what do they think and feel about their surroundings? Well, now you can find out for yourself! An innovative and novel initiative – Dialogue in the Dark – aims at creating awareness about the world of the blind by immersing sighted people in it and letting them experience it first-hand, with help from a guide who is visually impaired. DiD traces its origin to Germany back in 1988, and has so far reached out to 7 million visitors through 160 contact centres worldwide, while also providing employment to more than 7,000 visually impaired candidates.', 'When SV Krishnan stumbled into one such exhibit, thanks to a delayed flight in Atlanta, GA, it left a lasting and profound impression on him. He realised what an important and compensating role the other senses played for the blind, and he was amazed to see them come alive when he was placed in that situation. More importantly, he learnt a lot about the blind that he did not know before, and he felt greater empathy and respect for them. Says Krishnan,', 'During the exhibit, I was inspired by the reality of living without traditional sight, as “Dialogue”, by taking me through a series of ordinary events, such as visiting a park, buying candy, and taking a boat ride in complete darkness, revealed to me how the other 4 senses activate and function more keenly when vision is impaired. What I discovered to my great surprise was that the “blind,” so to speak, are not disabled. No, instead, they are specially abled.', 'Deeply moved and determined to introduce Indian audiences to such an experience, he began to think of how such education and entertainment can be combined to create a beautiful and meaningful enterprise. He felt Indians were ready to receive and appreciate such edutainment and take away valuable insights from it, while also being exposed to something new and thought-provoking. And was he right! He, along with co-founder Sudha, started an exhibit centre of DiD in Hyderabad in 2011, and in 16 months of existence, the centre has received more than 45,000 visitors!', 'Another important aspect of DiD is the sustainable social impact it aims to create. Besides building empathy and awareness among individuals for the disabled, it also creates meaningful employment opportunities for the visually impaired by hiring them as guides and trainers. These employees feel a special sense of empowerment, as here they are guiding the sighted in a world that, for a change, they are familiar and comfortable with. With this unique reversal of roles, the visually impaired feel in control and responsible for their sighted wards.', 'The exhibition itself consists of a range of different experiences, designed with a lot of thought behind them, in order to simulate the world of the blind. Visitors are handed canes to feel their way around and led into an area that is enveloped in pitch darkness. Their initial feelings of disconcertedness and fear are calmed by the gentle voice of their guide, who leads the group into different environs, such as a park, a supermarket, a boat-ride, a walk in the old city, ending with refreshments at the Taste of Darkness cafe. In all these situations, the visitors slowly adjust to the darkness that in effect annuls their sense of sight, and they learn to rely on the other sensory organs available to them – namely those of hearing, touch, smell and taste. They are made keenly aware of their heightened senses and realise that it is not that the blind cannot see, they just ‘see’ with different faculties.', 'Perhaps the most important ‘insight’ people can take away from such experiences, besides understanding, connecting with and empathising with the differently abled, is that losing one ability is not as devastating as they think it would be. We are all so afraid of losing what we have, that we think we cannot do without it. But going through such an exposure makes one realise that the problems we face in life are not insurmountable, and there is nothing that cannot be overcome. We do after all have many other senses or abilities to make up for what we have lost, and we can, in fact, put them to better use now.', 'For the Dialogue in the Dark experience, visit their first centre in India at Inorbit Mall, Hyderabad.

An Association makes an impact. When we approach a department to implement the rights mandated by the State Government, it does something about it.

The media has also been very helpful in highlighting our issues.', 'DRAG gets cases where qualified people have been denied promotions or employment because of a disability. Goa has a State Disability Commissioner whom disabled people can approach in case of injustice yet people are not aware about it.', '“DRAG was instrumental in Kadamba Transport Corporation buying two wheelchair accessible buses. It informs builders, colleges, schools about wheelchair friendly architecture. However, many temples, churches and mosques are still not accessible to the disabled thereby denying them the fundamental right to worship”. Avelino is a member of the Local Level (North Goa) Committee of the National Trust of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities.', 'My parents didn’t think about any special school or different education for me as in those days there was no choice. I had to be educated, hence was sent to the nearby school, like my siblings or like any other child. My mother regularly took me to the Spastics Society in Mumbai so that I got the correct kind of physiotherapy and other treatments at the right time. Today parents send their disabled children to special schools and I think these children lose out on many things as they do not get to interact with regular children.', 'Says Avelino, “At the Red Rosary High School, Miramar, I was expected to do my homework and take tests and exams like anyone else.

Dempo College of Commerce and Economics, Panjim.”', 'As we talk, Avelino takes notes: “I keep writing whatever comes to my mind, so that later I can tackle the points.” A cupboard shelf is full of trophies that he hasn’t told me about, from the Rotary Club of Panjim Riveira (for Vocational Service to the Disabled, 2009) and other institutions (for exceeding targets for Mutual Funds and other investments). On prodding, he tells me a charming story: “In 1994, I was in the third year of my graduation, in SS Dempo College. My classroom was on the first floor. I requested Principal Bhende to shift me to a ground floor class as I had difficulty in climbing stairs. He shifted the entire division to a room on the ground floor so that I had the familiar faces around me also.”', 'After a hectic but well-chalked out daily schedule, Avelino, the second youngest of five siblings, surfs the net and listens to gospel and Konkani songs. “I’m not fond of reading; with friends I keep in touch via the mobile phone. I’m involved in Church activities. I am also a member of the Crusaders for Jesus with Mary and the YMCA Panjim.”', 'What about the future? “Parents still don’t know where to take their disabled children and flounder in desperate confusion from place to place. Which means that the doctors, too, need to be educated about what’s available in Goa, so that they can guide their patients correctly.” I leave his office with his assurance that DRAG is working on that.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Mohanty felt the urgent need to break this cycle, and his idea of creating a grain bank for the largely tribal population of these villages has given them a new sense of ownership and self-respect.', 'Consider what life was like in Kotrakund village located in Boipariguda block of Odisha’s Koraput district. Mukta Pradhani, 40, a widow from this village, had a family land holding that amounted to about two acres of un-irrigated land. Her meagre wages as a farm labourer just could not keep her family of five fed. “Every year, I used to borrow money from the ‘sahukar’ (money lender) at 50 per cent interest. Some time ago, I reached a situation where I could not repay the money. The ‘sahukar’ then sent in his men to take away all my harvest. Those were horrible days. There was no food in the house, and my children were starving,” she reveals.', 'Take Reli Khilo, 47, who lives in Sisapadar village of Nandapur block. He works as a ‘dongar’ (hill cultivator) near his village and applied to the government for his rights over forest land. But since he did not possess proper agricultural implements, he found he could not get enough from the land to feed his family of eight. When he went to the gram panchayat to explain his dilemma, he was advised to take a loan from a local ‘sahukar’. Khilo went on to take a loan of four ‘manas’ (20 kilos) of grain, but could not repay it because of a failed harvest. He went back to the ‘sahukar’ to ask for some more time and was instructed to send his 11-year-old son to work as bonded labour for the ‘sahukar’. Says Khilo, “I spent a whole day waiting outside the sahukar’s door, trying to convince him that I will repay his loan in a year’s time. He didn’t even look at me. I felt miserable. It was like losing one’s self-respect.” Only later did Khilo discover that the local gram panchayat was totally under the control of the ‘sahukars’.', 'Stories like these are not unusual in the villages of Koraput, a district with tribals constituting more than half its population, most of who work as agricultural labour. For people already living on the edge, any adversity – a crop failure or a death in the family – can push them into the abyss of debt and bondage, and cases of children being sold have been reported in the local media.', 'The high levels of rural indebtedness in these villages provoked social activist Bidyut Mohanty, based in Koraput district, to study the issue more closely. He found that some villagers here were repaying the ‘sahukar’ 10 manas (50 kilos) for a loan of 5 manas (25 kilos) – an interest rate of 200 per cent – and realised that they needed urgent help. That was how the idea of introducing a grain bank – that would charge affordable interest rates – was decided on.', 'Mohanty, who heads Society for Promoting Rural Education and Development (SPREAD), a non-governmental organisation, convened a meeting of villagers about three years ago. The initial target area was the Nandapur and Lamtaput blocks of Koraput district, which are largely inhabited by tribals displaced during the 1956 construction of the Machhkund dam. Recalls Mohanty,', 'At that meeting in Kutumb village in Balel Gram Panchayat of Lamtaput block, it was unanimously decided that all the households of the village would contribute either paddy or ragi to set up a grain bank. Each household contributed three to five kilos of paddy and ragi, respectively, and our organisation agreed to contribute an equal or greater amount.', 'It is the Self Help Groups (SHGs) that managed the village grain banks. The loans were paid by the president or secretary of the local SHG, and he or she was made specifically responsible for maintaining accounts and records. Any grain stocks in excess of what was required to be maintained was sold in the open market and the proceeds invested with the village SHG to earn an interest.', 'At present, contributions from villagers in these two blocks have amounted to 33 quintals of paddy and 42.22 quintals of ragi, while SPREAD has contributed 198 quintals and 264 quintals of rice and ragi, respectively. During the first year, loans were given to 520 families – totaling 770 kilos of paddy and 1,120 kilos of ragi. Repayment of loans always takes place after the harvest, when farmers have disposable income.', 'At present, SPREAD alone has set up about 200 grain banks in Koraput. Business for the ‘sahukars’ has never been worse and Mukta Pradhani is delighted with this turn of events. “Since the formation of the grain bank in my village three years ago, I have not approached the ‘sahukar’ even once, and I have been able to keep my family fed,” she avers.', 'Khilo is equally relieved, and is extremely enthusiastic about the concept of a grain bank. He made sure that his was one of the 38 households in Sirsa Padar village of Kolabira gram panchayat to become a member of the local grain bank and he recently took a loan of five manas of paddy, which he is confident he will be able to repay, come the harvest, along with the interest as decided by the village committee. The man who felt so denuded of self-respect because of the high-handed ways of the ‘sahukar’ today looks on the grain bank as a symbol of self-respect and community ownership.', 'Others like Sonu Khinda, another landless tribal villager in Kutumb village of Lamtaput block – a cattle herder by occupation who has been forced to migrate to Andhra Pradesh for a few months every year to buttress his earnings – finds that the grain bank in his village has brought a new financial stability to his life. Although he still has to take the occasional loan to tide over difficult domestic situations, he can breathe easy now since he is no longer at the mercy of a ‘sahukar’. By not having to meet their exorbitant interest rates, he is no longer caught in the vicious cycle of debt, hunger and ever-increasing debt. He says he feels in better control of his life.', 'Recognising the positive impact of grain banks in ensuring food security, international agencies like the World Food Programme have helped to set up hundreds of grain banks in states like Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan that have seen high levels of malnutrition.', 'Finally, it is about what Reli Khilo describes as “self-respect”. As food activist Sukhram Gadenga, who is associated with SPREAD, put it, “There’s no doubt about it, grain banks have helped to provide greater autonomy for the tribals in this region.”', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
7,2012-7,"['Written by Gangadharan Menon', 'The Land of The Bishnois – Where Conservation Of Wildlife Is A Religion!']","['\n\n\nby\n\nGangadharan Menon\n\n\nJuly 3, 2012, 10:30 am \n\n\n', 'Travel with Gangadharan Menon to Rajasthan and meet with a people who have nurtured and protected the living species found around them for over five centuries, and who have successfully deterred, chased and also apprehended several poachers – including famous ones!', 'There’s probably only one religion in the world that’s founded solely on the principle of conserving Nature. That’s the living religion of the Bishnois of Rajasthan.', 'This religion is over 500 years old, and the followers are over 10 lakh. Imagine 10 lakh people for whom protection of all living things is a Way of Life. In fact, the only Way of Life. Why imagine? Take the first available conveyance to Jodhpur and you will find them.', 'This religion was founded by Lord Jambheshwar who is believed to be an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the preserver of all that’s created on earth.', 'Legend has it that till the age of seven, Jambheshwar never uttered a word. Concerned by this strange behaviour, his parents called in a priest. The priest suggested that a pooja be performed after lighting 64 lamps. The idea was to enlighten the boy.', 'In spite of their desperate efforts, not one of the oil-filled lamps could be lit. In the midst of all the commotion, little Jambheshwar picked up an earthen pot, tied it to a slender sewing thread and lowered it into the well. And quietly pulled out a pot full of water. Then he removed the oil from all the lamps and poured water in its place. And lo and behold, one by one all the 64 lamps lit up on their own.', 'Maybe even as a kid, he was enlightened enough to know that water is the very source of all life!', 'From the age of 8 to 34, Jambheshwar led the life of a cow-herd. Though he was born into the warrior clan of Rajputs, he chose to be different. Instead of developing hunting skills like the rest of his ilk, he developed communication skills with all living things. For hours on end he used to converse with plants and animals.', 'At the age of 34, Lord Jambheshwar sat on the shifting sand dunes of a place called Samrathal, and meditated on the transient nature of life itself. When he turned inwards he realised that he has to chart a course of his own. And sitting in that barren brown landscape he saw visions of a green paradise.', 'He then summoned his innumerable followers and told them that they need to follow a new belief system on which their entire life will be based. As their lives would be governed by these 29 principles, they would be called Bishnois; derived from the words “bees” that’s twenty, and “noi” that’s nine.', 'Though there are 29 tenets in this belief system, the most important of them all is ‘praan daya’ or compassion for all living things. For close to 525 years, every Bishnoi, young and old, has lived and even died for this spirit of compassion.', 'The Bishnois consider trees as sacred, but their empathy extends to every living being on earth. So they protect the entire ecosystem that exists in their villages. Animals like blackbucks and chinkaras, and birds like vultures, partridges, peacocks and even the endangered Great Indian Bustard, find the Bishnoi village a safe haven. Not only do the Bishnois protect them from poachers, they also actively participate in helping them lead a life of plenty. By allowing them to graze freely in their farmlands; by keeping stone vessels near their home that are always filled with water; and even hanging water-filled pots from the branches of trees for the birds to drink from.', 'Some Bishnoi temples also double up as rescue shelters, like the one in Jajiwal. Here the priest takes care of the injured nilgais, blackbucks and chinkaras, and even feeds them twice a day. Some of them go back into the wild, while the others prefer to stay in the temple compound, roaming free.', 'Even the Bishnoi women take maternal care of the rescued calves, sometimes breast feeding them if they are newly born. When they are able to walk and fend for themselves, they are released back into the wild.', 'A major change that’s happened in the 500-year psyche of the Bishnois is their shift from passive conservation to active conservation. Once upon a time they were content laying down their lives. Today they actively pursue armed poachers with a mere lathi and tonnes of courage, capture them and hand them over to the forest authorities. In the last twenty years alone, around 14 Bishnois have died defending these animals. The reflection of their new found aggression is an organisation called the Tiger Force. It’s a 1000-strong brigade of young, fearless warriors of wildlife protection. Spread across hundreds of villages across Jodhpur, they are now active even in other parts of Rajasthan.', 'Being nature lovers to the core, they bemoan the fact that, under the Indian Wildlife Act, animals are accorded various levels of importance. But to a Bishnoi, killing a monitor lizard is as hideous a crime as killing a tiger. To them, every life has the same value.', 'Though they protect every living organism in Nature, they shot into international prominence when they caught an Indian Superstar and his Supergang. The valiant Tiger Force had chased them and caught them red-handed with the blackbucks they had poached and killed.', 'The media coverage about the uncompromising spirit of the Bishnois sent shivers down the spines of poachers, and today these mercenaries think thrice before shooting down a helpless animal. So much so, that the die-hard poachers have even changed their modus operandi. Instead of shooting down the animal, they now lay booby traps or sometimes dig pits and cover them with thorns to catch unsuspecting animals. But seldom do these new methods escape the ever-vigilant eyes of a 1-million strong taskforce.', 'The spirit of conservation has been deeply ingrained in every Bishnoi for over five centuries. It arises from the belief that every living organism on this earth has an equal right to live. This intense love for animals brings a curious problem to the fore: feral dogs. Since a Bishnoi doesn’t harm even these vicious dogs, they have become the new predators of blackbucks and chinkaras. Conscious of the repercussions, the Bishnois in their own non-violent way get these dogs caught and sterilized so that the damage is limited.', 'When brutal attacks do happen, the Tiger Force swings into action and takes the injured animal to the rescue centre in Jodhpur. Here qualified veterinarians treat these animals with love and compassion; and if they recover well, release them back to where they belong: the wild.', 'An interesting aspect of wild animals living in close proximity to humans is that their behaviour has undergone some changes. They start believing that every human being is as compassionate as a Bishnoi. And this puts them at tremendous risk, especially with poachers.', 'Another change that has been observed by experts is in the mating rituals. Compared to the elaborate rituals that happen in the real wild, here in the villages they are short and curtailed.', 'But these are insignificant details when compared with the yeoman’s service this community has provided to itself and to mankind in terms of conserving an entire eco-system. It’s a well-known fact among conservationists that the total number of blackbucks and chinkaras in the Bishnoi villages is more than their number in all the sanctuaries of Rajasthan put together.', 'When you look into the eyes of a Bishnoi, you see a deep seated love for the forest and all that dwells in it. And you wonder why every single forest in India is not handed over to them for conserving its tremendous natural heritage.', 'The paradox of this community is that there are just a handful of them occupying influential positions in the forest department. And these passionate, upright and courageous officers point out the tragic reason behind this anomaly: widespread illiteracy that’s the bane of the Bishnois.', 'But one must admit that this compassion of the Bishnois is contagious. It’s catching on even in communities that are traditionally aggressive and consider hunting an adventurous sport: the Rajputs and the Jats. They have had a change of heart, and are now contributing in a big way towards conservation of nature and wildlife.', 'Five centuries ago, Lord Jambheshwar had dreamt of sand dunes turning into a green paradise – where every living organism has an equal right to the land. And where man and animal exist in perfect harmony.', 'The Bishnois of Rajasthan have been living out his dream. Every single day. For over 500 years. Isn’t there a lesson in this for the rest of us?', 'Gangadharan Menon is a nature writer, art teacher, and photographer of the wild.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
