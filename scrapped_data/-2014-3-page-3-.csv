Yes, that’s a big contribution of NGO Bhumi, one of India’s largest independent youth volunteer non-profit organisations.', 'Bhumi, an NGO with a big volunteer force, works among orphaned and underprivileged children in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, New Delhi and other parts of the country with the aim of providing children with quality supplementary education and enabling them to become responsible and productive citizens of the future.', 'Bhumi’s Ms.Vaishnavi Srinivasan, the Executive Director tells us more about the NGO and its vision.', 'Bhumi started off with a small yearning to do something for the nation in 2006. A bunch of us volunteered to teach children at an orphanage. The experience was an eye-opener about the status of the education system in the country. This motivated us to start Bhumi on August 15 of the same year. We wanted socially conscious and young Changemakers to associate this platform with something close to everyone’s heart – ‘Bhumi’ meaning Mother Earth in many Indian languages, what else could fit in better?', 'We also have an annual initiative by the name of ‘Joy to the World’ which aims to spread joy to underprivileged children by fulfilling their small wishes just ahead of the New Year. Over 5,000 children are expected to benefit this year. And then, we also have a Hi5 Club which is an initiative to promote volunteerism among youth who have never engaged in volunteering activities.', 'When asked if Indian youth is disoriented these days, Vaishnavi strongly disagreed and feels that today’s youth are the future of this nation and constitute a large chunk of enlightened population.', 'Bhumi would not be operational if not for our focused, driven and passionate young volunteers, who are all under the age of 30. Even though we have observed a few volunteers walking in for a certificate, most of our volunteers create an unbreakable bond with the children, and end up staying with Bhumi for a much longer period than they had initially planned. Even though we battle out challenges like attrition and irregularity in attending classes, a majority of our volunteers are committed and self-driven. If not us, who will change our country?', 'Vaishnavi told us that Bhumi team believes not only in just creating the platform, but setting the right direction and providing a wide platter of opportunities to nurture oneself (including leadership, inter-personal and communication skills) so as to encourage today’s youth to volunteer.', 'To encourage youth to volunteer, apart from highlighting the short-term benefits they are likely to get, we need to emphasize on bigger takeaways that are likely to impact their lives forever. Bhumi is managed by several young volunteers at every level, the centres, the projects, the chapters and then on an overall national scale. The average age of our team is 22-23 and consists of more or less equal number of students & working professionals of both sexes. While most of the volunteers contribute 2-4 hours per week; those who have chosen to spend a few hours beyond weekend volunteering constitute our support teams.', 'Bhumi raises funds from both corporate companies and individuals. While the former engage in continued corporate social responsibility, the latter donate a small amount every month and this sustained contribution goes towards the procurement of books, computers and other aids. Many of their volunteers also contribute every month towards Bhumi.', 'We wish to reach out to at least five more cities every year from now, and extend our programmes to more children across the country. We want to make volunteerism a national habit and plan to start a volunteer match programme linking volunteers with causes that matter to them (apart from Bhumi) sometime in 2014. Stay tuned to www.bhumi.org.in for details.', 'We appreciate the way Bhumi has capitalized on the volunteering force of Indian youth. Organizations like Bhumi are playing a catalyst role to direct India and the youth towards a better tomorrow.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Leave your attitude behind, we have our own.”', 'That’s what my Punekar friend’s profile picture proudly proclaims on Facebook. The legendary Pune ‘attitude’ forms a major fabric of the city’s culture – a subtle fact that I realized I’m going to constantly encounter while in the city.', 'Whenever I’d talk to friends who had studied in the ‘Oxford of the East’ – whether in law school, engineering, or MBA – they would reminisce about the city with a sigh and a strange misty look in their eyes. ‘Oh, I love that place’ followed by wistful memories of the city’s oft-celebrated campus life, markets, and other such frolic. This repeated reaction from so many people got me curiouser and curiouser. So obviously I needed to go see for myself what the fuss was all about. A day and a half was all I had, but I was told it would be good enough to see this charming little city inside out.', 'I was waiting in line for check-in when I happened to meet a city inhabitant who got talking about the familiar Pune attitude. She recollected an incident that had obviously stuck in her mind.', 'I had once taken an auto in Kalyani Nagar. There was a 2-rupee change left, so I asked the autowallah to just keep it. But he actually gave it back to me saying, ‘Madam, aap hi rakh lo. Is do rupaye ka main koi mahal nahi bana loonga.’ (Madam, you keep it. I won’t make a palace with these Rs.2). Talk about self-respect! I realized it’s the kind of thing that can happen nowhere else in India, except Pune.', 'I had to laugh at that, but realized only later how true it was, when, post my stay in Pune, I had taken the early morning chair car train (Sinhagad Express) to neighboring Mumbai. On reaching Mumbai in all its humid glory, I had hailed a cab to the airport. The driver asked me for Rs 545 at the end of the ride. I took out a 500-rupee note and handed it to him, while fishing for a 50 in my wallet. When I looked up, I found that he had hastily replaced the 500-rupee note in his hand with a 100. “Arre madam, 100 nahi, 500!” (Madam, not 100, 500)\xa0Though I was half asleep with fatigue on catching an early morning train, fortunately I was alert enough to remember that I had indeed handed him a 500-rupee note and not a 100. So I reminded him of the same and he was quiet. Luckily, I found Pune devoid of this trickery.', 'On landing in Pune, I was as if on a mission – to make maximum possible use of my precious time here. Luckily for me, my proud local friend very kindly offered to show me around. I was to learn further about the Maharashtrian adoration and loyalty for their city, which they repeatedly spoke fondly about and defended given any chance. It was almost as if they worshiped their history, thinking highly of their dynasty of kings and rulers, as well as all the ‘sons of the soil’ who had contributed to the freedom struggle.', 'Our first stop was the Main Street in Old Pune, which had neat, narrow roads. I had a quick look at The Bombay Store, which housed an exquisite collection of lifestyle products, artifacts, home décor, and fashion accessories – a perfect blend of contemporary and traditional techniques and art forms.', 'We then grabbed a quick lunch of some mouthwatering chutney sandwiches and juice at Marz-o-Rin, located just across the road. A heritage building that is over a century old, this fast-food joint serves more than 150 items at affordable prices.', 'My friend told me during lunch about the standard Puneri quirk of food not being available between 1 and 4 pm – as siesta time is of utmost importance. “The residents are very content and not very ambitious when it comes to earning money. They value their afternoon nap more than an extra buck of business!”\xa0That fuelled my friend into another story:', 'There is a man who works as a waiter in Vaishali restaurant on F.C. road. He met me and told me that his son was an MBA. I asked him why he was working as a waiter in a restaurant. He told me that he liked the work and is content with the money he gets. He will continue to do this till the day he retires.', 'The city is hugely influenced by education – another distinct aspect I was to learn more about. Apparently, most of the engineers who pass out of colleges in Pune, head to the U.S. for higher job prospects. The parents of this NRI population form a huge number and have even formed an association known as Non Resident Indians’ Parents’ Organization (NRIPO). The NRIPO is a non-profit, voluntary support group for ageing parents of NRIs that provides them emotional support and comfort in their twilight years.', 'After having filled our stomachs, we headed into the city streets: M.G. road, East street, Camp area, J.M. road, and most of the major locations were all close by. I observed the city’s characteristic coffee house and bike culture – with strong independent women zooming from place to place.', 'Toward the evening, we headed to Koregaon Park. I had heard a lot about all its hip watering holes. My first stop of course was to the long-running German Bakery, which I noticed looked absolutely well restored, with the only remnant of the blast being the heightened security at the entrance.', 'On the road just opposite was the popular Osho meditation resort, a lush tropical oasis which people from all over the world visit every year.', 'Still later in the evening, I relished some native vada pav and chaat from a roadside dhaba on Laxmi road. This was followed by the sumptuous mango mastini, a typical Puneri ice cream cold drink I was craving to try. With that, I was full and my first day in Pune drew to a close.', 'The next morning, we drove by the city’s cosmopolitan IT parks and SEZs, comprising all the big software and manufacturing companies. After that, I also got to see prominent universities, like Symbiosis College, ILS Law College, Fergusson College, Film and Television Institute of India, and a string of engineering colleges. They had some of the most picturesque campuses – providing a very inspiring environment for studying.', 'We also drove up to Khadakwasla dam, a beautiful drive on way to the Sinhagad Fort. The area also has the well-known National Defence Academy.', 'For lunch, I tried George restaurant, known for its diverse continental, Mughlai, and Indian cuisine.', 'In the evening, we climbed up 103 stairs to reach the Parvati temple, which was built in the Peshwa dynasty rule and provides a panoramic view of the entire city. Next up was Shaniwar Wada, a palace fort which served as the seat of the Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire. I was also fortunate enough to squeeze in a visit to Raja Dinkar Kelkar museum, which houses a marvelous one-man collection of about 21,000 priceless relics, including sculptures, kitchen utensils, paintings, weapons, musical instruments, textiles, and toys in brass, wood, ivory, earthenware, terracotta, and bronze.', 'I remembered to grab some of the famous shrewsbury biscuits from the Kayani bakery as well as some of the delicious indigenous bakarwadi from Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale.', 'My last evening in Pune was spent having a splendid non-vegetarian meal with friends at the Green Park hotel on Baner road, amidst conversation, joy, and laughter – the ideal way to end a superb trip. As I boarded the train to Bombay the next morning, someone casually asked me what I thought of Pune.

Read how a lone Malguzaar spearheaded their revival in 2008.', 'Malguzari tanks were ponds made for water harvesting by the Malguzaars, who were Zamindars/tenants in eastern Vidarbha, Maharashtra two centuries ago.These tanks provided water for irrigation and also increased the availability of fish for local consumption.', 'Before 1950, the Malguzaars constructed, owned and maintained these water tanks but things changed after that when the Malguzari/Zamindari system was abolished. The state government took ownership of these tanks and started collecting water tax on whichever lands they irrigated. This angered the Malguzaars and prompted them to file a case in the Supreme Court saying that they were the rightful owners. The Supreme Court agreed with them but didn’t lay down conditions for who should maintain these tanks. More than 1000 tanks in the Vidarbha region bore the brunt of this decision and went unmaintained since then.', 'In 1983, an independent committee ruled that the tanks, which were of great significance to modern irrigation projects, were indeed the government’s responsibility to maintain. But no one took heed of this and the tanks remained unmaintained until 2008 when Shirish Apte entered the picture.', 'Shirish Apte, an Executive Engineer of Minor Irrigation division of Bhandara also belonged to a Malguzaar family. He had always had a great interest in water conservation and decided to initiate the process of rejuvenating these tanks. With monetary support from the government, he started this work.', 'The first tank that was restored in 2008 was the Janbhora Malguzari tank located 35 kms away from Bhandara. The first step was to de-silt the tank to remove the fine sand and earth that is carried by moving water and deposited as a sediment. The community got together and de-silted the tank. After the de-silting was completed, the boundary wall of the tank was strengthened. The work was fully completed in 2009 – 2010. This rejuvenation work has resulted in recharging groundwater levels and has also increased agricultural output and fish production in the area.', 'Employment levels have also increased because of this. The benefits of the Jambhora Malguzari tank to the region has prompted the district administration to restore another 21 Malguzari tanks in Bhandara.', 'The video below, shot in Vidarbha, gives a brief overview of the initiative to rejuvenate the Malguari tanks undertaken by the district administration in the area. (Click here if you cannot view the video below).', 'Bigger isn’t necessarily better. The revival of the Malguzaari tanks has shown that there are cheaper and simpler methods for water conservation than the construction of big dams. Smaller projects such as this aren’t as expensive to implement and more importantly, the buy-in from the community and the ownership that the people feel can’t be replicated with bigger state-run projects.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Yes, you heard that right! When we talk of mobiles in the context of health, it is usually harmful radiations that come to our mind. But who knew that radar signals and Android technology, if utilized wisely and with the mission to do good, could lead to improved health? Sevamob thought differently in this way, and combined Android tablets and medical expertise to deliver primary healthcare and insurance to low-income consumers and disadvantaged communities in rural and urban India.', 'Sevamob, headquartered in Atlanta, USA with a fully owned subsidiary in India, was started by entrepreneur Shelley Saxena in 2011. Backed by an extensive business experience and armed with an MBA from Cornell and B.E. from IIT Roorkee, Shelley had managed several multi-million dollar products for IBM and co-founded a cash-flow positive mobile technology startup, Saasmob. Sevamob was the next plunge into innovative, technological and social entrepreneurship. Says Shelley,', 'I was born in Lucknow in India where we started this service. Friends, relatives, acquaintances and sometimes complete strangers helped me get to where I am today. “Seva” is service in Hindi and “mob” is short for mobile. So the name means mobile service. By addressing basic needs of people in a state where illiteracy is as high as 40% and 79% of the population lives in rural areas, I can fundamentally transform the lives of people in a self-sustainable way.', 'Usually, one of the challenges in a business venture is the initial establishing phase. In the case of Sevamob, however, this was a relatively smooth sail, thanks to Shelley’s sound financial and technological background. Economics and technology were just the perfect ingredients required to bring take Sevamob from concept form to launch in only 2 months! Shelley explains,\xa0“While most companies spend first couple of years figuring out the business model, we have executed very efficiently and in just 2 years established an innovative model for primary healthcare and received various awards and recognition for it.”', 'Sevamob’s service delivery is streamlined through a cloud based mobile platform, which is not outsourced but has been developed in-house itself. This is how it works: their monthly subscription based primary healthcare is delivered through mobile clinics staffed with doctors carrying Android tablets. Then at signup, the team captures patient demographics and medical record in the software and gives a subscriber card to the patient. Once a month, basic primary care is delivered on-premise. This includes preventive care (BP, Sugar, ECG, BMI, Dental, Vision, Diet plan etc), prescriptions and medicines for common ailments. For advanced issues, prescription requests are created in software. These go to back-office specialists who either give a prescription or set up a no-charge appointment. Select plans include hospitalization benefits for up-to INR 50K/year and accident insurance for INR 100,000. Subscribers can call a 24×7 helpline for service requests.', 'Sevamob is currently successfully serving in Lucknow city, Kakori, Mohanlal Gunj, Barabanki and Unnao in Uttar Pradesh. In Liberia (Africa) too, this model has been replicated through a licensee. At its inception, although a sound business model had been developed, there were other challenges that had to be countered, which again they did victoriously. Recalls Shelley:', 'Due to my first startup, we already had resources and network in Uttar Pradesh to get Sevamob off the ground in Dec 2011. While we were initially tight on capital, in Aug 2012, Village Capital invested $50K in Sevamob after a rigorous 2 months program in which peers select the companies for investment. That seed capital and the access to the social impact network we received was the breakthrough moment for us.', 'Besides Village Capital, they have received recognition from several other organizations like Nasscom Foundation, mBillionth Awards, Mahindra Rise and Artha Venture Challenge.', 'The main goal of Sevamob is to fundamentally transform the delivery of primary healthcare in the developing countries, particularly for the low-income segment that has limited access to primary healthcare and limited awareness about insurance. Increase in sick days, loss of income and no safety net for emergencies is the unfortunate result of deprivation of primary healthcare. Middle and upper income consumers too are hungry for information about quality healthcare services.', 'Sevamob is serving 3 low-income customer segments in 2nd, 3rd and 4th tier towns and cities. Primary healthcare (covering health education for students, parents, staff, OPD checkup, dental, BMI Height/Weight management, diet plan, vision screening, bad habit correction/sex education, hearing examination, pathology test, etc) is being given to school students in these zones. An on-premise school nurse would also be provided during school hours for a minimum 1000 student subscribers in a school branch.', 'The Sevamob services are also being provided to employees. Primary healthcare (including OPD checkup, dental, vision screening, BMI, diet plan and pathology test), accident insurance and cashless health policy are the benefits that employees can get. Talking about the unique ‘cashless’ health policy, Shelley says, “It’s a New India Insurance policy that we bundle in one plan. It provides up to Rs50,000 of hospitalization benefits in in-network hospitals, in a given financial year.”', 'The multi-faceted and well-integrated Sevamob team is supported by back-office specialists, a 24×7 call center and a network of 3rd party service providers like hospitals, clinics and pathologists. The field teams are equipped with Android tablets having mobile software which can operate without network even in the most remote areas.', 'The SevaAngels service is another distinguished feature of Sevamob. Through this service, sponsored primary healthcare to kids in orphanages and elderly people in old age homes is delivered. Shelley elaborates:', 'Our web-based service, SevaAngels, enables people to sponsor healthcare of kids in orphanages or elderly people in old age homes and track health updates of the sponsored people online. Currently we are serving more than 35 schools, businesses, orphanages and old age homes. Our impact includes children (students in low-income schools and kids in orphanages), employees (low income employees in factories, unions, services organizations) and the retirees (elderly people in old age homes).', 'Although there are already in existence various organizations providing either phone-based advice or setting up kiosks/clinics in remote areas for providing health checkups, the basic difference when it comes to Sevamob is in its approach itself. Explains Shelley:', 'These approaches have various limitations, especially when it comes to providing comprehensive primary healthcare to low income consumers in a scalable fashion. With our innovative model, we hope to address these limitations and challenges, for the low-income segment.', 'While Sevamob is doing a fabulous job in its designated zones, the health venture is at a nascent stage and rearing to spread its wings across a wider territory. Their goal is to scale from 4000 subscribers in 2013 to 240,000 direct subscribers within 5 years in India. They also plan to replicate the model in additional geographies. Shelley talks about spreading awareness:', 'We are spreading the word through various social impact conferences, competitions and blogs. We acquire new customers through direct sales force, resellers and licensees. Various private organizations including NGOs have partnered with us both to resell our services as well as promote their products and services to our customer base. We have so far not received any help from the Government organizations despite engaging them at various levels.', 'We hope Team Sevamob scales higher reaches and betters the health of several more people, cutting across social and economic boundaries.

If so what?', 'The approach for training and coaching is similar for normal as well as for special cricket.', 'It’s the same game, ground and format except for some additional rules. It’s just that blind players need to have more concentration, listening skills, gazing power and timing.

I was feeling very privileged playing for the nation as if I’ve grown in a day all sudden. I was feeling like a celebrity, an important face like Sachin. I resolved to create something incredible so that this series reminds all cricketers of my contribution for ever. Because I feel that I am slightly unlucky when it comes to opportunities, I played thinking that was my last tournament therefore I had to give my best. But thankfully luck favored me and for three years consecutively I have played for the country so far.', 'I would never forget Devnar School for the Blind where I did my schooling and learnt lessons in real life, and Cricket of course. I was in fifth standard when I happened to come across a game of cricket with sound ball. I was amazed to know about it.', 'As cricket was my favorite game, I had been playing since the time I had partial vision. I was a very active player, all the time playing with friends and neighbors. But when my eye vision drastically reduced, I didn’t understand what was happening with me. It was very difficult to accept that I’m now a visually impaired person having some sight problem. When I used to play with rubber ball in the streets and school ground, with very little vision in the eye – struggling to see the ball, failing to stop the ball or misjudge – I couldn’t realize that I’m in a category belonging to person with visually challenges. I was 9 years old when I was admitted into Devnar School. It was then that I understood that I’m like the students in Devnar Perhaps (Blind).', 'It was Mr. Chandrasekar the PET (Physical Education Trainer) who trained me and others, and I’m grateful to him for his seamless effort. I owe gratitude to Devnar School and P. Chandrashekar.', 'Q. What has been your most memorable moment on field?', 'There are many. But whenever I think about it, I recall the first release of ball from my hand while bowling my first ever international ball on wicket, going straight to hit the middle stump, which proved that Mahender is a dangerous wicket-taker.', 'The second one is against Pakistan in 2012 with two powerful set batsmen on the crease who gave me a terrible time in the first spell. It was my last bowling over, and the first ball of the over took one of the set Pakistani players\xa0off the field, caught in the mid wicket. When the 2nd player came to the batting crease changing the end, he got out in a similar fashion to the first man. So I was on a hat trick. One more world record would get registered in my name if I could take a wicket on the 3rd ball also. But that didn’t happen. On the 4th and 5th delivery I got another 2 consecutive wickets. And again I was on hat trick! One more opportunity to create a world record and become the first blind man to take a hat trick. But this time also I failed. Four wickets and 1 run in that over; the best over so far makes me remember it again and again.', 'Q: You have been a vice captain of the Indian cricket team. What has been your major contribution as a vice captain?', 'I was vice captain in designation but led the team from the front. My nature is to encourage and be friendly with the team. My decisions were respected by the captain and others in the team. When we won the series in India against world champion Pakistan, I was the VC and my strategic planning helped in defeating Pakistan. This satisfied me a lot.', 'Q: Since how long have you been playing for India? What are your other roles in the blind cricket association apart from being a cricketer?', 'On field, I have been playing for India since 2010. I was given the opportunity to play for India in the past during the second World Cup at Chennai in 2002, and in 2006-07 but unfortunately could not attend due to final matriculation and degree examination.', 'Cricket has been my passion for years, since childhood. Students are normally punished by teachers at school for their irresponsiveness towards education, negligence and stubbornness. Perhaps, I was only the student who got punished for playing cricket, despite being studious in the class.', 'I’m not only a cricketer but also play a role in organizing cricket tournaments. I’m the vice President of Andhra Pradesh Cricket Association for the Blind. I wish to create opportunities and conduct tournaments with the help of private donors for those who, like me, have the determination and love for cricket. My aim is to expose people with visual impairment (PVI) to everybody in the society through cricket so that it can be recognized that their abilities are on par with normal players. Through cricket, I would like to improve their personality, increase their confidence level, make them fight all odds and take responsibility of their future, so that they can feel good about their valuable life.', 'Q: You have won an award from LV Prasad Institute for your contribution in Cricket. Do you think such awards will gain more recognition for Indian Blind Cricket?', 'Such awards have to be many. After playing for years, that was the first notable recognition I have received. I would say, everybody should be recognized, they all deserve to be. Civil societies, NGOs, private institutes and particularly the government should encourage and recognize such an incredible game and players. This would motivate the players and help in boosting confidence.', 'Q: Can you tell more about the NGO Samanvai and your role there?', 'Samanvai is an NGO to support Blind and multiple disabled. It helps to rehabilitate kids with special need and concern. Samanvai helps to teach computers to PVI, record and scan study material, education support, employment, mentoring and such help to the welfare of PWD in general and particularly PVI.', 'It’s an initiative flourished by a group of active volunteers who were helping needy children like me post shool. I’m also an active member who regularly participates in organization management to help the needy in education and skill enhancement. I help in counseling, career guidance, organizing events/picnic and cricket tournament.', 'Q: What are your future plans in the field of cricket?', 'Apart from playing, mentoring, coaching, organizing tournaments to provide players ample opportunity, aim is to get separate cricket ground for blind cricket. It is sad but it is very difficult for us to get a ground to play on – nobody is willing to help or even encouraging. If we own our own cricket ground then we will be able to play peacefully.', 'Q: Can you tell us about how you are encouraging more players to come in and play?', 'We are fighting for BCCI affiliation to adopt this game like it did in the case of women cricket. We have been fighting for years but BCCI strike offs ignoring to least. There are enormously talented players emerging every year, the competition is rapidly growing but, they are not getting enough opportunity to prove.', 'To create more and more opportunity and recognition, we are asking every state to have a Cricket Board to monitor, organize and control games in the states. This will help players by providing opportunities to some extent. Equally we are lobbying for the game recognition, focus and support so that this special game is respected by all in the society. If these players are also equally supported and rewarded, it would help them to gain self-respect, \xa0acceptance, satisfaction and a good life because of cricket.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

While those infants usually grow up to be Amitabh Bachchan, have you ever wondered if this happens in real life? And what happens to those unfortunate children left abandoned? Here we tell you about ‘Palna’, and its parent organization Delhi Council for Child Welfare, which has been taking care of such children from over six decades!', '[dropcap size=small]A[/dropcap]sha Dijkastra, 34, is a confident young lady. After completing her Masters in History of Education in Holland she is now an educational consultant organizing workshops for teachers doing Bachelor of Education in Holland. Today, Asha might be a Dutch national but she traces her roots back to Delhi, India, where she was born and abandoned. She was adopted by her current Dutch parents when she was barely 5 months old. She says: “Today, after 34 years, I still feel I belong to India because of my name.”', 'Asha was adopted from Palna, a home for the abandoned, homeless and destitute children run by the Delhi Council for Child Welfare (DCCW). Today she is a successful professional in Holland but says she has two homes – one at Palna and one in Holland. Recently, when she was in Palna she organized a small excursion to Pratapgad Farms and took around 30 children for a picnic there. She says: “Although I haven’t lived long in India, deep down I feel a very strong connection that Palna was once my home and still is. When I’m there I feel blessed with the unconditional love and spirituality among the people.” Apart from feeling close to the children at Palna she is also raising funds for Palna. So far she has sent about 130 euros besides clothes and toys.', 'Asha’s is not the only success story there are many such success stories from Palna that was established in 1978, and located in Qudsia Bagh, Old Delhi', 'Dr Sandhya Bhalla, CEO, DCCW says that Palna is an outcome of their own learning from the past. She explains:', 'The forming of DCCW dates back to the time of partition when many children got lost or misplaced during the riots. The families living along the Civil Lines used to take care of these children. They did all that was required for these children. In 1952, DCCW was established as an NGO.', 'Then DCCW used to run a daycare centre for the Government called ‘Palna’. We used to work with various agencies and through this day care centre adoptions used to take place. Later the Government came up with a regulation to have a license for placing children in adoption. Today, we precisely have one home with a ‘Palna’ or cradle outside and we do not have any branches across Delhi for Palna.', 'Palna is a haven of peace, security and stability for the children who come here. Today on an average Palna looks after 90-100 children daily ranging in the age group of newborns to 8-year-olds.', 'The emphasis in Palna is on total care. Palna’s multi-specialty medical programme, non-formal educational sessions and recreational facilities and activities, address all aspects of children’s development, good health and overall well-being.', 'The Adoption programme in Palna started in 1978. Says Dr. Bhalla:', 'We at DCCW believe that a child does not belong in an institution, but in a family. The first effort is to trace the family and restore the child to its birth parents. When it is established that the child is abandoned or has not been claimed by its family, all efforts are made to place it in adoption.', 'On an average DCCW gives away 50 children in adoption annually within India and abroad. Over the last three decades the organization has placed over 2800 children in loving families, selected after rigorous screening and evaluation procedures.', 'Once the cradle or Palna as they call it was kept out, DCCW officials also realized that a lot of parents left their disabled or mentally challenged child there. The number only kept increasing which then prompted DCCW to start Bal Chetna programme in 2002. Bal Chetna is DCCW’s Respite Home and Day-care facility for mentally challenged children. Apart from more children being abandoned at Palna, the other impetus to start Bal Chetna for mentally challenged children was surveys done by DCCW’s crèche workers in the neighbourhoods in which they worked indicating that there was a high proportion of children with mental disabilities who were not getting the attention they needed.', 'An increasing number of children with cerebral palsy and children with multiple disabilities had started to come to the Orthopaedic Centre at Janakpuri for help and advice.', 'Today, Bal Chetna comprises residential facilities for homeless mentally challenged infants at Palna, as well as day care facilities for children from economically backward families at Janakpuri, New Seemapuri, Nithari and Sultanpuri in Delhi. Each centre has about 30 children. By providing individualized and specialized care, Bal Chetna facilitates the stimulation and development of special needs children, with the objective of making each child as self-reliant, competent and communicative as is possible.', 'DCCW has also been doing a lot in the educational area for children from the under-privileged families. They started an educational scholarship programme wherein they provide financial support to academically bright children from low-income families who would otherwise be forced to drop out of school due to economic constraints. Academically inclined children – including physically challenged children – from families whose monthly income is no more than Rs.4000/- are eligible for sponsorship under this programme. At present about a 1000 children receive the scholarship', 'Dr Bhalla says the impact of this programme has been positive with the result that it has kept the children back in school without any drop outs and secondly other children who are in the vicinity of these kids and find that they are capable of getting this scholarship are also coming forward for it.', 'Parents and children are both seeing value in this programme not just from being at school and excelling but also from an overall development point of view as they also get career counseling. Many of these children are doing well. Some have even got into Engineering and Medical colleges.', 'That’s not all. In order to impart skills to enable differently-abled children, school dropout girls as well as other children from low-income families to support themselves, DCCW started a Vocational Training programme in 1976. Through this programme they conduct training in cutting and tailoring, embroidey, painting and Beauty Courses. Informs Dr. Bhalla.', 'Our focus for this programme has largely been on girls in the age group of 15-18 years. To a large extent these girls are married off by their parents forcing them to drop out of schools. But, the impact of our programme has been positive with most of these girls now having a job in large beauty salons like Lakme or L’O real or having started something on their own.', 'It has also automatically deferred their marriage. The girls are more confident and have a sense of pride of being independent and earning for themselves and their family.', 'Sunita, is one such girl who has benefited from the vocational training programme. She came from a family who could barely dream of anything beyond one square meal. Sunita enrolled in DCCW’s Beauty Culture Training programme and is today running her very own beauty parlour ‘Madhu Beauty Parlour’ in Dakshin Puri.', 'Similarly, there is Tarannum. She belongs to a family of seven and her father is the only earning member. She came to DCCW to take a course in cutting and tailoring and now takes sewing orders from the community around her and brings in Rs. 2000 to 2500 every month. Tarannum is now dreaming big of becoming an entrepreneur, with her own shop and staff.', 'Currently, there are about 400 youngsters from across Delhi who register with DCCW for the vocational training programme. Bhalla and her staff are now looking to add other courses in the areas of cooking and baking.', 'With a mission to provide every child with a childhood and have a society where all children have all that is rightfully theirs and every opportunity to realize their potential, over the decades, DCCW’s programmes have grown and diversified to cover medical services, nutrition, vocational training, adoption, rehabilitation of physically and mentally children and the provision of day care and non-formal education to the underprivileged children of Delhi and the surrounding areas. Today, these services reach approximately 2500 children daily and are provided virtually free of cost to them.', 'While all these programmes are being run successfully with a staff strength of over 70 individuals, many of whom who have been with DCCW for almost two decades or more, Dr Bhalla says that they are still faced with challenges. Says Dr. Bhalla:', 'Our biggest challenge is that of finances. Cost of services is rising. We are thankful to our staff who have been with us for so long despite these challenges. They are with us because of our ethics and philosophy.', 'Running an NGO is a challenge in this country and the biggest challenge is that of raising funds and maintaining transparency. DCCW’s Bhalla says they have no issues with transparency as everything is accounted for in the books. And, according to her, it’s this working philosophy that has kept her staff here for so long despite the low salaries.', 'DCCW’s idea is to now build a huge corpus so that they can provide the best for their children and also take care of their staff. Towards this effort, since March 2013, DCCW has been listed on GiveIndia as a Tier1 organisation after a rigorous audit and verification process. Dr. Bhalla explains:', 'The partnership with GiveIndia has specifically helped us to reach out to individual donors across the world who would otherwise not have known about DCCW and the various programs undertaken and the number of children reached out to and the impact on the beneficiaries. It also helps to immediately establish our credibility when we approach corporates for support.', 'Going forward, Dr Bhalla and the DCCW council members are clear that irrespective of the challenges, the effort will be towards making DCCW self-sustaining. We wish DCCW the very best in their efforts and hope that many more less-privileged children realise their dreams through them.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Human trafficking has become the 3rd largest illegal industry after the arms and drugs industry. The project coordinator (North) of Rescue Foundation, Mr J R Sharan joins us to talk about the menace of human trafficking.', 'Would you be amazed if you are told that 90 per cent of the human trafficking in India is internal and those from the most disadvantaged sections, including the lower castes are the most victimized ones?', 'This fact was recently brought to light by the US State Department report on India. Shamefully, India is now considered to be the source, destination and transit point for men, women and children subjected to forced labour and sex trafficking.', 'The only saving grace amid such statistics is that we still have NGOs like Rescue Foundation that are working with commitment to rescue, rehabilitate and repatriate victims of human trafficking rescued from different parts of India, Nepal & Bangladesh. All these victims were sold for forced prostitution, a fact told to us by Mr J R Sharan. He is the project coordinator for this NGO in North India and a journalist by profession with more than 25 years of experience.', 'Established in 2000 by the late Balkrishna Acharya, Rescue Foundation is now managed by his wife Triveni, and is a non-profit, government-recognized and registered NGO working to fulfill its duties to this most neglected segment of our society. Our primary aim is to ensure that women’s human rights are respected, protected, and fulfilled. On an average, our organization helps rescue 300 girls a year. We make sure that after rescue, these women and girls live a life of dignity for which we try to give them necessary training in various vocations and life skills.', 'Mr Sharan told us that they are the only NGO is New Delhi to rescue 160 girls; all other NGOs lag far behind.', 'Human trafficking is a serious offence. To combat the problem, we need a consistent approach and dedicated team who is there to track the leads we get from the missing person’s records. Our team investigates relentlessly and conducts rescue raids with police’s help. You can yourself verify how earnestly we have been working on this by checking the records in Kamla Nehru Police Station. And rescue is not the only task we do; rather it is just the beginning. The rescued girls are then brought to our protective home in Boisar (60 kms from Mumbai) where they undergo a medical examination and are given a strict health regime to follow.', 'The idea behind all this is to make sure that all these girls are physically and emotionally confident enough to start a new life on their own.', 'We were also told that many times, the rescued girls turn out to be HIV positive. The NGO has an in-house pathological laboratory and permanent doctors on duty as well who are there to fully take care of the girls. These girls are given a good diet rich in proteins and vitamins like milk, fruits and vegetables which are cultivated by the group members themselves in their Boisar Recovery Care Centre.', 'Mr Sharan also told us some stark truths of this sex-trade in India.', 'Believe it or not, India has more than 50 million girls working forcibly in this illegal trade. In New Delhi alone, we have 180 red light areas and every police personnel is aware of it. Yet no action is taken, simply because there exists an appalling nexus between the Politicians, Police and brothel owners. It was due to our acute pressure that we were able to get 13 kothas (brothels) seized in New Delhi.', 'The misery does not end here! Mr Sharan had some more facts to share that stare us in the face while none of us has any answer or justification.', 'Maximum number of trafficked girls falls in the age bracket of 8-10 years and they fetch the highest money for the brothel. And when I talk of money, let me candidly tell you – Sex trade in India has now become Rs 4 lakh crore industry! Out of this huge sum of money involved, a prostitute ends up earning not even 400 rupees every day! So pathetic is the condition of these girls and women that they are not given dinner until they entertain 20 clients a day.', 'Mr Sharan shared stories of girls from well-off families who were duped into this trade by their friend or boy friend!', 'The world is not at all like a glossy magazine; it is like the front page of a newspaper. But the problem is either we are too busy in negative reporting or too indifferent towards such problems! How much does it take to be a little sensitive towards a helpless girl?

We lack the courage to raise our voice and compassion to empathize with her situation.

For 10 years after that, he was not allowed to step out of his house. Now, he not only goes to work everyday, but earns well, lives on his own and is completely self-reliant. Once a grateful recipient of a scholarship that helped him complete his studies in Finance and MBA, he is now a giver of scholarships and also participates in policy making. Can anything better illustrate the impact made by persons with disability if given half a chance in our society?', 'His name is Raja Mahendra Pratap. His friends call him Pratap, Mahendra or Raja. As we spoke to him, the 29-year old enthusiastic youth went around doing his daily chores. He combed his hair, locked his home and moved towards his office. If the lift of any building is non-functional then he climbs up without getting tired or exhausted. Whenever he crosses a road or is outdoors, people peep at him. He is physically different from the rest of us. He loves to see the amazed faces of people and the look of appreciation in their eyes. Both his hands and legs are severed from his ankles and knees. This young man is full of confidence as he works as a Finance and Accounts Officer at ONGC, Ahmedabad. He has studied Finance and MBA, and takes home a handsome salary.', 'Pratap hails from Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. When he was five years old, a small bet changed his life forever. His friend threw him a challenge that Pratap could not hold an iron rod into an open electric wire. Pratap drew courage and held an iron rod into high voltage electric current. Within seconds electricity surged through his entire body. The accident resulted into amputation of legs and hands. Since that day till the age of 16, Pratap never moved out from his house. He would stay confined in the four walls of his room. Whenever he recollects those ten years of his life, he states:', 'I would stay in my room. My father felt embarrassed to call me in front of guests. He considered me a burden and good for nothing', 'He couldn’t attend school from age of 6 to 16. During those years he had never stepped out of his house. He was from a middle-class family and yet to stitch his clothes, a tailor would be called at home. Similarly, during illness, a doctor would come to his place and give treatment. His three elder sisters stood by him and encouraged him a lot. He acquired knowledge by studying their books. Since he couldn’t walk, he would crawl on the floor which rubbed off his skin at the joints. Gradually he learned to walk. Similarly, with the help of his mouth and ankle, he would try to lift things. Now, he can efficiently use the computer with his mouth and ankle, can write with the help of his jaws and walk on his knees.', 'Four years ago Pratap sat with a cobbler and made him design shoes as per his need. Earlier, no cobbler was ready to make his sandals until finally one of them agreed. He took two days to make a sandal for him. At Ahmedabad no cobbler is ready to make sandals for him. ‘They are getting paid for making sandals yet are not ready to do so. I don’t experience any agony whenever I come across such situations,’ says Pratap. He cleared his tenth and twelfth without attending school. The first time when he got the opportunity to step out of his home, his joy had no limits. There was no looking back for him. He cleared his B.Com and completed his Finance and MBA from Osmania University.', 'He received scholarship from Delhi-based ‘National Center for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People”. The scholarship amount of Rs.1000 for a year enabled him to complete his course in Finance. Today he gives scholarship to disabled students.', 'He received a lot of interview calls while job-hunting, but once the interviewers saw him, their attitude changed. Nobody was willing to believe that he would be able to accomplish the work allotted to him. The attitude of society towards him disturbed him, but he continued his search for a job. Finally he landed a job as Assistant Manager in National Housing Bank, Delhi. Pratap’s job changed the attitude of his father towards him. Currently he works as Finance and Accounts Officer in ONGC, Ahmedabad. He has full support of his colleagues and superiors. In his current as well as previous organizations, Pratap has always earned respect and love. The manager of ONGC is very happy with the efficiency and commitment of Pratap. “He never feels awkward, he is self-made and never fails to do work assigned to him”.\xa0 He recollects when a form was to filled, his colleagues offered to help him but he refused and did it himself.', ' // <![CDATA[\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n// ]]&gt;', 'Illora, a colleague of Pratap, was surprised to see the work done by him. Gradually people began to see his potential and will power. Soon he earned respect among all his colleagues and they accepted him. Pratap travels around the world like a free bird which still amazes Illora. She states that “Whenever a new task is assigned, Pratap leads from the front”. His colleagues are very happy to have him. They have never witnessed a negative attitude from Pratap. People and society should understand that hiring people with disability is no crime or charity.', 'He stays at the quarters allotted to him by the organization and does all the work by himself – whether it’s washing clothes, making snacks etc. He is still unmarried and his family stays at Hyderabad. He is a good host, he treats his guests very well and stays socially connected with his friends and family through phone. He travels without any assistance in bus, train and plane and enjoys playing carrom and chess. What is special about Pratap is his quality to laugh at himself. He smiles when someone calls him as squat or undersized. He considers himself to be a normal person.', 'Assign me any work; I am capable of doing all of them. I don’t need sympathy of people. Treat me normally and I will love it. I wish that people and society treat disabled with respect and accept them. ', 'Pratap doesn’t feel a sense of loss in his life. He is a stern youth with a bundle of confidence and a strong will power.', 'When he met us, it was his birthday. He doesn’t believe in celebrating birthdays. He considers it to be just another day, a new milestone. He wants to lead an independent life rather than depend on others. He has represented India at the ‘World Disabled Forum” held at China and Japan.', 'Special facilities are made to make the public places accessible to the handicapped. They don’t face any discrimination or obstacles. In our country there is a dearth of obstacle-free environment.', 'Many people like Pratap voice their opinion that “compared to other nation, our nation is less disabled-friendly”.\xa0Public places, theatre, transport facility, railway stations, airport, art gallery should not be far from the reach of persons with disability. He stresses on the need for friendly and accessible environment for handicapped, children and elderly people. The attitude of people and society needs to change towards the disabled. The society, instead of respecting and accepting them, looks upon them as burden.', 'People like Pratap are called ‘handicapped’ but we should not forget the fact that each individual is handicapped in one or other form. Each one of us has some physical, emotional or mental weakness. The people whom we call handicapped are capable in one or other way. They have a good grasping power and are strong within. They prove themselves time and again by doing a different work. That is why they are now called differently-abled. As per national data, 2.7 crore people are disabled, which is effectively about 2.21% of the population. The 1995 Act states protection of rights, obstacle-free environment and equal participation and opportunities in all the sectors for persons with disability.

No, we are not talking about the Mayawatis, Jayalalithas and Mamta Banerjees of this country, but profiling some of the unsung heroines at the most local rungs of governance, who are bringing about change in real terms. Having overcome several challenges on the personal front, these women have taken it upon themselves to improve the condition of girls and women in their communities. You’ll be amazed at how much progress is possible under Women Power!', 'Young or old, educated or illiterate, savvy or simple – local self governments in India have thrown up some real-life political heroines, who have worked hard to make the lives of their communities better. Displaying remarkable skills they have emerged as architects of change and empowerment at the grassroots.', 'Shushma Bhadu, 35, is one of those progressive women from rural Haryana who has chosen her own future by entering public life. Elected in 2010 as the sarpanch of the Dhani Miyan Gram Panchayat in Fatehabad district, she has proven to be a true revolutionary.', 'In a state that is known to reject the girl child, Bhadu has managed to make her village of Dhani Miyan Khan, located nine kilometres from Fatehabad town, a ‘model’ when it comes to women’s rights and the survival of daughters.', 'To put an end to the inhuman practice of female foeticide, this feisty leader announced a handsome cash reward of Rs 51,000 for informers who provide tip-offs on those seeking and conducting sex determination tests and backroom abortions. In addition, she instructed the local anganwadi and other health workers to remain alert and immediately intimate the panchayat in case any such incident came to light. As a result of this approach, even though Haryana in general presents a bleak picture when it comes to the female sex ratio, “focused efforts in Dhani Miyan Khan have produced excellent results. The village has 426 females to 416 males”, informs Bhadu.', 'At the same time the leader has taken on the charge of educating local girls very seriously. Though a Class Seven dropout herself, she is determined to ensure that no child in her area remains illiterate. Under her leadership, the panchayat has started covering the fees as well as expenses incurred on uniforms and books for girl students up to Class Five for those parents who cannot afford to support their daughters’ schooling.', 'The outcome of this move has already started yielding results. It has not only given every child in the village an opportunity to study up to Class Five, if not higher, attendance is reportedly 100 per cent now with zero dropouts. In fact, students of higher classes, who have to go to distant schools, have been provided with cycles to help them continue their studies. “Every family wants educated, qualified daughters-in-law. So I try to explain to them that if they don’t send their own daughters to school, their sons will not get educated wives,” says Bhadu, in a matter-of-fact manner.', 'While she may not have undergone formal education, the leader does have experience and vision that have enabled her to draw up a road map for the girls of the community. Elaborates Bhadu:', 'I hold meetings with parents, mostly mothers, in small groups and try to explain to them that if they do not educate their daughters, their fate, too, will be sealed like them and the vicious cycle of struggle for survival will continue for generations together. Their daughters will remain shackled by household work.', 'Despite belonging to the conservative Bishnoi community that does not allow its womenfolk to move around without the ‘ghunghat‘ (veil to cover their face), Bhadu has broken conventions to exercise her rights as a progressive woman. She discarded the veil as she found it an obstruction to her work and her initiative has given other women the confidence to shun this age-old practice that is extremely restrictive.', 'One major factor that has helped her village to script such tremendous success stories is the panchayat leader’s constant endeavour at advocacy and information dissemination in the community. Under Bhadu’s stewardship, a tailoring centre has been set up where women gain vocational training and she has arranged funding from a bank to sponsor these women as they set out to be entrepreneurs.', 'Bhadu’s work for women’s emancipation and empowerment in Dhani Miyan recently brought her the Outstanding Women Leaders Panchayat Award, instituted by the Institute of Social Sciences.', 'Like Bhadu, Nayana Patra, 45, too, was recognised in the same way. Patra has devised her own unique strategy to liberate the women of her ward, the Baraun Gram Panchayat of Dhenkenal district in Odisha. Whether it has to do with the health of the environment or adivasi rights, whether it concerns education or sanitation, this ward member has been able to make a significant difference.', 'But of all her interventions, it is her innovative method of putting an end to alcoholism in her village that has gained her the support of the people. By imposing a fine on those found drunk, she managed not only to discourage such anti-social behaviour, but to create a fund to build toilets in the village.', 'While sanitation continues to be an issue routinely neglected by the civic administration of many towns and cities across India, Baraun has able to built six public toilets at convenient places to usher in a higher standard of public hygiene than it has ever known.', 'Patra, who has been elected a ward member twice, and was given the Outstanding Women Panchayat leaders Award 2013 for her initiative and leadership qualities.', 'Her project of getting a residential school built for village girls is an example of her community-centric approach. There was no school in Baraun and so the children had to undertake a very risky journey to attend classes at the nearest institution located on the other side of a dense forest.', 'In the late 1980s, Patra enrolled herself along with her daughter in a literacy mission. That is when she realised the importance of girls’ education and the idea of building a school for them came to her mind. Once she decided to enter public life, she worked steadfastly to set up the school. There were many challenges to be faced. First, she had to secure funds from different sources under various government schemes, including the MLA fund. Then began the tough job of getting the school constructed. Today, over 150 girls gain an education through this school and among them is Patra’s granddaughter!', 'Unlike most other schools, this one gives mid day meals to students from Class I to VIII and keeps a strict vigil on the quality of the food served. For instance, Patra recalls, that when they realised that the Self Help Groups were not managing the meals properly, they were immediately replaced with a seven-member Village Education Committee. The members of this committee come from different castes and classes and are part of the panchayat.', 'Seeing Patra’s energy, capacity for forward thinking and experience, all newly elected panchayat members invariably consult her before initiating any programme. She may belong to a backward community but she understands the needs of the entire community very well.', 'Another arena in which Patra has proved herself is the protection of the local forests from the timber mafia. She has put together a brigade of fierce women to patrol the 250-acre Sal forest that abuts the village. “There is an old saying here that where there is forest, there will be water and fresh air necessary for life. So we decided to take up patrolling seriously,” informs Patra. Five groups of 15-20 women have been formed and they discharge their forest protection duties by rotation, each with a stick in her hand. Simultaneously, Patra has helped in planting around a thousand cashew plants on unused government land.', 'As Bhadu and Patra have shown, women’s leadership at the grassroots is helping communities make a transition from stagnation to change.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Here we touch upon her early years, her love for poetry, her transformation into an activist, and try to understand the making of a legend.', 'It began in the November of 2000. It began as a movement against senseless violence, a reaction to the loss of innocent lives, a protest against an unjust law. It has been over 13 years since and one determined woman is still awaiting deliverance. It is not everyone who can demonstrate such relentless courage of conviction and determination in the face of intense pressure and intimidation. Perhaps that’s the reason why Irom Chanu Sharmila is dubbed ‘The Iron Lady of Manipur’. Over the years, Sharmila has become a symbol for championing the cause of human rights. What started as a small step has now become a landmark struggle and a movement of iconic resistance.', 'The Trigger\nGrowing up in Manipur, Sharmila loved the land of her birth and was entranced by the stories of Gods and Goddesses, kings and queens, as related to her by her grandmother. Like most people of Manipur, Sharmila grew up with a strong loyalty to the land. Right from an early age, Sharmila was passionate about defending the causes that she deeply cared about. She actively espoused social issues during her college days and participated in rallies to protest against violation of civil rights. Sharmila was also part communities such as the All-Manipur Students’ Union for Sightless, Centre for Organization Research and Education, Human Rights Alert among others. People close to Sharmila talk about her passion for journalism and literature right from an early age.', 'But it was the incident at Malom that triggered Irom Sharmila to take a drastic step. In November 2000, 10 civilians were killed in a shooting allegedly perpetrated by the Assam Rifles, which is part of the Indian Paramilitary forces. Among the victims were a 62 year old woman and an 18 year old boy. The incident which became known as the Malom Massacre outraged the 28 year old Sharmila to such an extent that she announced a fast unto death, unless the AFSPA was revoked. Incidentally, the shooting took place on a Thursday, a day that Sharmila usually observed a fast. She simply continued with her fast indefinitely. This declaration from Sharmila brought the contentious Act under the glare of national and international media, springing Irom Sharmila into the spotlight.', 'Just three days after her protest, Sharmila was arrested for “attempt to commit suicide” which is considered an offence under the Indian Penal Code. She was later transferred to judicial custody, where her deteriorating health condition caused the authorities to force feed her through nasogastric intubation, in other words, feed her through a tube attached to her nose. Sharmila has been regularly arrested and released ever since she began her hunger strike. But nothing seems to deter Sharmila from her goal.', 'Sharmila’s Continued Activism, Her Fight For Human Rights\nIt has been 13 years since Sharmila waged her protest against the Malom Massacre, but despite her multiple pleas, the government has been reluctant to act on the matter. Some political factions have assured Sharmila of repealing the armed forces special power from places where the army is not required, while others have suggested modifications to the Act that provides great impunity to the army personnel. Despite these pledges, nothing concrete has come to fruition as yet. But that hasn’t discouraged Sharmila in the least. In 2006, she travelled to Delhi to pay tribute to her idol, Mahatma Gandhi. While in the capital, she staged a protest demonstration at Jantar Mantar where she was joined by students and human rights activists. The event failed to garner media attention and just a few days later she was re-arrested on her return from Delhi for attempting suicide through her hunger strike.', 'Sharmila has continually written to the Prime Minister and Home Minister seeking their intervention in the matter. She won the support of Nobel Laureate, Shirin Ebadi, who promised to take up Sharmila’s cause at the UN Human Right’s Council. In 2011, she wrote a heartfelt letter to Anna Hazare, who had captured the nation’s attention in his fight against corruption. In her letter, she extended an invitation to the Gandhian to visit her in Imphal. Sharmila was successful in securing Anna’s support for her cause.', 'What is AFSPA? \nThe armed force special power act was passed in 1958 by the parliament. It comprises of six sections in which it grants special powers to the armed forces in ‘disturbed areas’. In recent times, however, the act has come under severe scrutiny and faced criticism from many quarters. The U.N too has questioned the validity and constitutionality of the AFSPA and termed it as “dated and colonial-era law that breach contemporary international human rights standard.” The U.N has urged India to revoke the act.', 'Laws are meant to protect people against crimes, violence and injustice, but in case of AFSPA, the very essence of the act seems to go against the principles of law. A redressal would certainly be in order, sooner rather than later.', 'The Poet and Her Muse\nApart from her commendable commitment for championing social causes, Sharmila is also a talented poet. She has written over 100 poems in Bengali. Few of her works such as Birth and Fragrance of Peace have been translated to English. Birth is an ambitious poem of 1000 lines which captures a gamut of life experiences including her childhood, her views about society and her take on things she has witnessed and experienced. Sharmila completed this poem within a span of six weeks.', 'Loneliness and memories is Sharmila’s muse and death is a recurring theme in her poetry, much in contrast to her personal love of life. Sharmila is like a child in many ways and that is reflected in her writings too. Through her writings, Sharmila has showed the world that although she may be physically restrained and held captive in solitary confinement, her imagination cannot be shackled.', 'International Attention and Honours\nHer historic protest has not only garnered international attention but has also won Sharmila many awards and honours. In 2012, she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the North East Network. Sharmila is also the recipient of Gwangju Prize for Human Rights which includes a $125,000 prize money. She donated this money to the victims of human rights violation in Manipur. Additionally, Sharmila has also been honoured with the Rabindranath Tagore Peace Prize, Sarva Gunah Sampannah Award for Peace and Harmony and Adivasi Ratna Award. In 2010, Sharmila won a lifetime achievement award from the Asian Human Rights Commission. She has refused to accept any award until her demand of repealing AFSPA is fulfilled, which she probably considers to be the best reward for her struggle.', 'In 2009 Deepti Priya Mehrotra presented a moving portrait of the Iron Lady in her book Burning Bright: Irom Sharmila and the Struggle for Peace in Manipur. The book traces the journey of Sharmila with a detailed backdrop of the history of Manipur.', 'Perhaps Sharmila’s life has not been free of controversy. But can we ever expect anybody’s to be? Especially someone who is constantly in the public glare? In 2011, Sharmila’s personal life came under the scanner and received a good deal of attention, when she confessed her feelings for Desmond Coutinho, a 48-year old writer and activist. Her supporters who have exalted Sharmila and put her on a pedestal found it hard to reconcile to this personal aspect of the activist. However, none of this has diminished her dedication to her cause, and she braves on steadfastly.', 'One often wonders about the intriguing and self-sacrificing nature of activists. What gives them the courage to stand firmly by the causes they believe in, or give up so much of their life for the well-being of others? Irom Sharmila has always maintained that her struggle is spiritual. Perhaps that’s where she draws her strength from. Her unrelenting efforts and unflagging steely resolve, has made Sharmila an icon and an inspiration.', 'Her struggle may be ongoing, but that does not mean success has been elusive. The mere fact that modification of AFSPA is now being discussed in party meetings and among political leaders is a testament to her achievement. Sharmila has single handedly managed to create enormous awareness about a cause that she deeply believes in. She has sought and secured the support of activists and human rights organizations across the world. In October 2013, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) ordered the state government to lift restrictions imposed on access to Sharmila. All these are suggestive of the progress she has made. Sharmila has fought a long and hard battle for the preservation of civil rights and the time to savour victory, we hope, is not far away.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

I would like to clarify that ETASHA works in the development sector for the benefit of youth, but we do not give charity.

Then, we also have a Project Umang which is a Spoken English and Computing program for teachers at ITI Gurgaon. This one is funded by donors who contributed to ETASHA’s campaign during the 2012 Airtel Delhi Half Marathon.', 'Meenakshi feels that India’s unemployment and underemployment problem is particularly affecting those from lower socio-economic communities.', 'Poor families remain in poverty simply because they do not have the necessary skills to survive in competitive times of today. ETASHA wishes to see them joining the organised sector which will provides them access to better salaries, cleaner and safer working conditions, fixed hours, job security, career growth and often other benefits such as free transport, healthcare and insurance. And our concept to achieve the same is simple – we work with industry to identify growth areas and skill gaps and train young people from disadvantaged communities to begin careers in those industries.', 'Here’s a video explaining why ETASHA was founded and why training of disadvantaged young Indians is so important for the development of India (if you cannot watch the video below, please click on this Youtube\xa0link):', 'ETASHA is running Career Development Centres (CDCs), dynamic training hubs in slum communities in south Delhi, from which their community mobilisation team engages with local youth and their families, community and religious leaders as well as other NGOs.
