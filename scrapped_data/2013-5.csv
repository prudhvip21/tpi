1,2013-5,"['Written by Gangadharan Menon', 'TBI Travel: KOYNA – A Sanctuary Caught Between Preservation and Destruction']","['\n\n\nby\n\nGangadharan Menon\n\n\nMay 24, 2013, 1:18 pm \n\n\n', 'Join us in a visual tour of Koyna, a beautiful wildlife sanctuary nestled in the Western Ghats, in the Satara district of Maharshtra, where you could be fortunate to witness a breathtaking variety of flora and fauna such as the Indian Bengal tiger, Indian bison, leopards, barking deer, along with a wonderful selection of birds and snakes. Be with us as we identify the threats facing this fragile eco-system and applaud the effort of a few good souls to preserve the ecological gem.', 'There is a fort called Vasota nestling in the green mountains deep inside the Koyna Sanctuary. Protected by deep gorges all around and guarded by ferocious tigers that roamed the valley, it was nearly inaccessible. Though it was built by Raja Bhoj, it was conquered by the Marathas. At the peak of Maratha power, a few Englishmen were kept prisoners here. Subsequently, the Marathas lost the Anglo-Maratha War of 1818. But the news of defeat took two years to travel to this fort. And the imprisoned Englishmen had to continue their life as prisoners for two long years despite winning the war!', 'Once a dam was built on the confluence of the three rivers, Koyna, Solshi and Kandati, the inaccessible forest suddenly became accessible. Because the backwaters of the dam, stretched for all of 65 kilometres, encircling the mountains like water-snakes. And now you can enter this sanctuary only by boat from Shivsagar Lake.', 'We set off from our base in Tapola, and took the necessary permission from the Range Officer in Bamnoli. The Forest Guard, Gore, accompanied us on our 45-minute boat journey to the sanctuary.', 'Koyna by summer and Koyna by winter are two completely different landscapes. Post monsoon, the deep gorges get filled with rainwater and the water level rises over 600 feet, and the boat can be anchored right at the forest gate. Since we made our trip in summer and the water level was just about a 100 feet, the boat had to be moored far away, and we had to make an arduous journey of about two kms over loose boulders strewn all along the path.', 'We took the trail to Vasota fort and soon chanced upon the pugmarks of the elusive Pangolin or the ant-eater. Gore explained a unique characteristic of this strange-looking animal that has hard scales on its body. When threatened, it has the habit of rolling into a rock-like ball, thus making it impregnable to man or beast!', 'Then we walked under dense overhanging boughs through a tunnel of blue butterflies, and this added an ethereal touch to our walk. That was when Gore demonstrated the art of walking on dried leaves without making a sound. The trick, he told us in a whisper, is to land the heel first and then the rest of the foot. And presto, soon we were walking as if in a silent movie!', 'When we settled down near a Ganesh temple in the middle of nowhere, a barking deer darted across with its distinctive dog-like bark. The packed spartan lunch of chapathi and egg burji was washed down with water from the cool mountain stream, and we started on our journey back. By then we had realized that we had stopped once too often to stare at the wondrous woods, and we couldn’t possibly reach Vasota and return by dusk.', 'Sitting in the boat that was chugging back to the madding crowd in Tapola, I wondered about the fate of this fragile forest. There are allegations of forest land having been sold to resort owners, and windmills having been set up in the corridors of animal migration; and the matter is sub-judice. Add to this the promotion of Tapola as the New Mahabaleshwar to decongest the well-known hill-station that’s just 25 kms away. Will the decongestion of Mahabaleshwar result in the congestion and eventual destruction of the natural treasures of Koyna? I hope it does not, ever.', 'And this hope rests on the fact that the Western Ghats has recently been bestowed upon the title of a World Heritage Site by Unesco for its tremendous natural heritage and rich bio-diversity, and the steps taken by the authorities and concerned activists.', 'In an attempt to stop any further deterioration of the ecology inside Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary, the Bombay High Court has imposed an interim stay on construction activities in the protected forests. The high court has also directed the government to take steps to remove encroachments inside the notified sanctuary.', 'The HC directives came following a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Nana Khamkar, an environmental activist from Satara. Khamkar’s PIL also challenged the New Mahabaleshwar Project which is to be undertaken by the Maharashtra government with the view to decongest the twin hill stations of Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani. Says Khamkar,', 'We had been watching windmills and resorts for years, but nobody knew that they were inside the sanctuary. It was only after we saw the map of Sahyadri Tiger Reserve which had Koyna as its core zone that we doubted the activities.', 'The sanctuary has been declared an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International, a global network of bird conservation organisations. It has endangered bird species like red-headed vulture and white stork. The Maharashtra state government also declared Sahyadri Tiger Reserve comprising Koyna Sanctuary and Chandoli National Park in January 2010.', 'Add to this the news that Mohan Karnat, an upright forest officer, has taken over as the Chief Conservator of this Tiger Reserve. He was instrumental in stopping the mining activities in the famed Tadoba National Park a few years ago and saving it from destruction. Surely we can expect an encore from him.', 'So, fortunately for Koyna, and hence for us, there is hope!', 'Gangadharan Menon is a nature writer, art teacher, and photographer of the wild.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
2,2013-5,"['Archives', 'Sahyog – A Unique Village For Over A 1000 Deserted People']","['There are several people our society does not accept willingly. The leprosy-affected and the mentally handicapped are some of them. Imagine an entire village dedicated to them, where they can live freely and without prejudice, and receive loving care and attention from dedicated staff. This is what Sahyog Kushtha Yagna Trust in Gujarat attempts to achieve.', 'What is the perception about any village in India? That it would consist of a religious place, school, health center, well, small homes and many more things. There is a similar village next to Shamaliya, 27 kms along the highway from Himmatnagar to Shamlaji, Sabarkantha district. The village is known as Sahyog, and is spread over an area of 30 acre. The village is established by Sahyog Trust and the residents are suffering from leprosy. It is also home to several mentally challenged people.', 'Sahyog Kushtha Yagna Trust started its services in year 1988. In all there are 433 leprosy-afflicted persons living like a joint family and trying to fill the emptiness of their isolated life. The largest number of people suffering from leprosy come from Maharashtra, apart from them patients from Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Bengal, and Tamil Nadu live here. People and children who have been cured from leprosy also stay and study at Sahyog. There are 239 children of leprosy-affected parents residing there currently.', 'The virus of leprosy is similar to that of Tuberculosis and 95% of the time it does not spread. Only five out of 100 people are affected by the disease. It can be cured if proper treatment is received. The disease is about to be eradicated from the state of Gujarat. In the year 1988, 28 people out of 10000 suffered from leprosy which now exists only among 0.86 people. The national data shows 2 to 3 people out of 10000 suffering from the disease. “Credit needs to be given to the Gujarat government for bringing down the rate of leprosy in the state”, says Suresh Soni, founder of Sahyog trust.', 'It seems that Suresh was born to serve the leprosy affected. Born and brought up in a lower middle class family, Suresh completed MSc (Masters in Science) with a First Class, but did not want to live his life as a Maths teacher. He would stay with the leprosy affected at Shram Mandir trust for the entire day. In the year 1988, to help and give support to the affected, he founded Sahyog trust. He and his wife Indira would serve the sick and needy. The annual cost of serving people comes to around one crore and ten lakhs. The trust gets a grant of Rs. 20 lakhs from government, every year there is deficit of Rs. 92 lakhs.', 'The village has a hospital, an electoral booth, a primary school, a grocery shop. 30% people in the village are completely bedridden. Tea, snacks and food to these people are provided at their home by the staff. People like Abdul Mohammad Hafiz, a retired military officer, also stay happily in this environment. Many patients from all over the country come regularly to Sahyog and sometimes make it their permanent residential address. There are also a few who return to their village once they are cured.', 'During our visit, there was an addition of Prakash Deshmukh to the Sahyog Family. He is a resident of Kolhapur, Maharashtra. As a kid there were small patches on his body but he ignored them. When it was finally showed to a doctor, it was told that they are signs of leprosy. By then he was married and had kids. As soon as his wife came to know about this, her behavior towards him changed and soon she left him. A lot of effort was made for reconciliation but it was not successful. Prakash’s brothers also disowned him. He travelled all the way from Maharashtra to Gujarat with all the belongings he possessed.', 'Many people like Prakash get love and compassion from Suresh, his family and 40-45 staff of the trust. The love and affection for this people is reflected from the environment of the village. The area of 30 acre is maintained hygienically. There are beautiful paintings on the walls of each home. There is a basil plant in front of every home and a daily prayer is sung. The lines says “O almighty bless the person who has and is helping us, the place and people at our native should stay happy.”', 'Apart from the leprosy affected, mentally challenged people also stay at Sahyog. Suresh relates the history of including the mentally challenged to his big family. In 1994, Amri, a mentally retarded girl was raped, which culminated in her pregnancy. She stayed at women protection cell in Godhra. By then she was already 6-7 month pregnant. She was shifted to the women protection home at Vadodara and further transferred to a Mental hospital for better treatment. They refused to admit her as she was pregnant. District hospital also did the same. With the permission of director, Social Welfare and Juvenile board, she reached Sahyog Trust. Amri found a home in this place and delivered a baby boy. The boy studies at the primary school. And Amri? She shares a smile while greeting people in the village.', 'Today 192 male and 153 female mentally challenged have found a home at Sahyog. Apart from them, 29 visually impaired people are also looked after by the trust. The trust is working hard to make the mentally challenged independent by training them in small job. Suresh states “leprosy affected people suffer themselves, whereas mentally retarded don’t suffer, it’s their family which suffers. They can neither live nor die peacefully.”', 'Leprosy affected, mentally handicapped and people with other disabilities need constant love and consideration. The effort by the trust is commendable. Suresh and his team are striving to make ends meet. Anyone who wants to contribute towards the cause is welcomed.

3,2013-5,"['Archives', 'The Irony Of Iconhood – The Life And Times Of Bhanwari Devi']","['India’s rape culture has given birth to many women activists and icons. Bhanwari Devi, a victim of gang-rape in 1992, is one of them. As an epitome of sheer courage and conviction, she inspires women to take a stand for their rights. But the irony of the whole situation is that even after she has won awards, recognition and leadership status at all levels, her very basic need, justice, remains unfulfilled!', '“Only justice can fill my belly, not awards,” says Bhanwari Devi in response to a question from the audience about whether or not she had been recognised by international awards. She was speaking at a meeting organised by the Alternative Law Forum, Bangalore. The previous day, along with other leaders, Bhanwari had roused a massive rally in Mangalore with her fiery calls for solidarity and action against violence against women.', 'The Mangalore March 8th program itself was phenomenal, from all accounts The unprecedented coalition of women’s and progressive groups (almost a hundred groups) to raise a voice against the saffronization of Karnataka’s coastal belt and increasing attacks on women, has been the outcome of dedicated work by the Forum Against Atrocities on Women (the Mahila Dourjnya Virodi Vedike, Karnataka).', 'With delicious irony, Bhanwari, Urmila Pawar and other invited activists were accommodated at ‘Morning Mist’, the homestay that was ransacked by right-wing goons who broke up a private celebration there last June. That none of the events, which saw the mobilization of more than 5000 women, made it to even the Bangalore editions of the dailies, leave aside the national editions, is a matter of dismay, but won’t go into that right now.\xa0(Some photos of the event are available here)', 'Here I just wanted to share what some of us were talking about soon after Bhanwari’s talk. Many of the questions, particularly from the press (and apparently this happened even in the meeting earlier in the day), kept pushing Bhanwari back into the victim mode and somehow managed to zero in on her vulnerabilities. It is no surprise then, that she broke down on stage even 20 years after she was gang raped.', 'Some of us tried to steer the discussion to the context in which she worked – the context in which women’s safety as workers led to the Vishaka Guidelines. Again, no surprise, that nothing much has changed for Sathins on the ground. As the lowest rung of the Women’s Development Program in Rajasthan, their job is to act as a bridge between the government and the masses, essentially, implementing and making any number of government schemes palatable. They continue to work in precarious conditions, for a monthly pittance of Rs 1600 (raised from Rs 200 in the 1990s, after determined work by the Mahila Vikas Abhikaran Sathin Karamchari Sangh, many of us in women’s groups in Delhi at the time were part of the support group, so are aware of just what an uphill battle that was), as described in a Saheli newsletter in 1997.', 'The task of “consciousness raising” or stopping “social evils” like dowry, sex selection, child marriage etc can be extremely precarious, especially at the village level with deeply entrenched feudal, caste and patriarchal structures. How many of us, asked one Shyama Narang in the audience, would enter people’s houses and demand that they stop child marriage or refuse to take dowry? Bhanwari was raped while attempting to overturn exactly these sorts of practices. Needless to say, there is no job security, no transport, and no support at all from the government for doing this risky work. This is only part of the larger critique of the WDP.', 'For someone who has worked in the government-run Women’s Development Program, it was somewhat ironic that her focus was on individual effort, collective action and non-government efforts if any change was to come about. She spoke of her efforts to educate her daughter Rameshwari (a bright and confident young woman who accompanied her to Mangalore-Bangalore) – she is now an MA B.ed and teaches in a school. Bhanwari spoke of the support she had received from her husband, activists in Jaipur and women’s solidarity in general. As for the rape case, Bhanwari does not talk much about, frustrated by the legal process and the appeal by her rapists pending in the High Court.', 'It is deeply ironical that the icon of the Vishaka Guidelines to deal with sexual harassment at the workplace finds the whole effort of law reform utterly futile and of no real help to women. Her response to deal with perpetrators of violence against women is to round them up and beat them. She was also in favour of death penalty for rapists, while responding to a question from a journalist in the audience: what should be done about the juvenile perpetrator of the ‘Delhi gang rape”?', 'Bhanwari’s anguished response underlines once more why the best opportunity to undertake law reform might not be during times of trauma, emotional distress or mass mobilization, despite popular notions or even a progressive groups’ understanding of “striking while the iron is hot”. The job of reviewing or making laws is better done when one is somewhat removed from the situation. It is in the nature of Commissions and government response to agitations that they pick and choose what suits the status quo, but to appear to be responding to popular sentiment and “public mood” (however that is defined) gives the regime brownie points that the feminists are loathe to give.', 'As for Bhanwari, her life goes on, and that’s the wonderful part. True grit, impassioned activist, flame of hope – all the clichés in our lexicon can’t even begin to describe her.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

While some welcomed the idea declaring it a clarion call, others saw in the move an abject disconnect between the burning issue and the offered solution. Banks for women, many hailed, were novel budding ideas even though many such banks were functioning away from the public eye.', 'The Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), founded by Ela Bhatt in Gujarat, is a labour union of poor self-employed women workers in the informal economy. In the month synonymous with the budget, Ela Bhatt was conferred with the coveted Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development for a lifetime devoted to empowering women in India and elsewhere through grassroots entrepreneurship, healthcare, micro-finance, micro-insurance among several others.', 'Working as a federation, SEWA Bharat operates a unique program in the hills of Uttarakhand. More than 75% of Uttarakhand’s population comes under the category of ‘rural’. Owing to the high altitude, poor connectivity with roads and thinly spread population, bank services in such areas are often very limited. In order to bridge the chasm between rural areas and banking services, SEWA in collaboration with the State Bank of India (SBI) began a unique initiative of financial inclusion in 2009.', 'SEWA-SBI Financial Inclusion Programme employs selected women from the community as Customer Service Points (CSPs). SBI issues a Business Correspondent Code to each of the CSPs. Technology provider, A little World, generates a unique CSP ID and issues them Point of Service (POS) Machines.', 'With the help of these machines, no-frills accounts are opened by recording identities of customers through fingerprints, voice recording and photographs thereby enabling a spectrum of transactions. Deposit savings (Fixed Deposit/Recurring Deposit), withdrawal, remittance, loan applications in addition to pension distribution are readily made available through this model of financial inclusion. Once the data is entered and linked to the corresponding account, it is uploaded to SBI’s Mumbai server through GPRS culminating with the registration of the account.', 'Prem Lata, an enthusiastic Customer Service Provider, elaborates on the benefits of the programme:', 'In the hills, banks are scarcely located and every trip to the bank demands time and money. In addition to this, customers attribute heavy documentation work with opening of bank accounts. SEWA-SBI Financial Inclusion Programme makes the bank come to the customers and requires minimal documentation.', 'Anu, one of the account holders, wears a satisfied smile when a question about the programme is posed, “We used to feel very unfortunate in the absence of banking services. With this programme, we are not only saving money but are also more aware of government schemes we can avail.”', 'The rural population of Uttarakhand primarily consists of the elderly, women and young children. Men regularly venture out to the cities looking for better employment opportunities. Agriculture, albeit difficult, alongside animal husbandry, have been the main occupations of these women.

You stay in small but comfortable traditional village homes, and enjoy some delicious local cuisine prepared by your hosts. The organisation even arranges for treks in the deodar and birch forests of the national park with local guides who know the local flora and fauna like the back of their hands. Learn more about this interesting model of community-backed tourism.', 'Harshmani Bhatt, 25, is a young lad from Uttarkashi. This simple village boy is a high school graduate and had no skills attached to him until he joined Mountain Shepherds (MS). He was trained at the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) at Uttarkashi and has been working with the MS as a guide since 2006. In a good trekking season (June-October) he says he earns about 12,000 to 15,000 and sometimes more.

The Nanda Devi Sanctuary Trek retraces the pioneering steps of mountaineers Eric Shipton and H. W. Tilman through the Garhwal Himalayas in 1934.', 'It’s their exploration of the inner sanctuary that set the stage for all subsequent mountaineering expeditions. Till 1982 though, the entire region around Nanda Devi was declared a national park and all human activity banned inside the inner sanctuary. The well-meaning conservation efforts had a devastating impact on the local economy.', 'Against this backdrop, the Nanda Devi Campaign, led by the locals was launched in 1990s. The campaign was the struggle of the Bhotiya community, an Indo-Tibetan tribe, to regain forest rights in their homeland – the upper reaches of the Himalayas.', 'In 2002, almost two decades after the government banned tourism in the region to preserve its ecology, Sunil Dutt Kainthola, a psychologist and Dhan Singh Rana, a community leader from Lata village in Chamoli district, joined hands with people from the nearby villages in the region to launch the Mountain Shepherds initiative.', 'Their primary objective was to improve the living standards of the Bhotiyas by promoting eco-friendly adventure tourism. Says Kainthola, the head of Mountain Shepherds, headquartered at Lata village in Chamoli district:', 'We are trying to evolve a model of community-owned tourism where the community is not a mere beneficiary but among the main stakeholders in the tourism enterprise of the region.', 'To this end, Mountain Shepherds directly plans treks to the sanctuary and other places in the Garhwal Himalayas including skiing in Auli. Many of these packages involve long treks with home stays that allow tourists to take in the breathtaking sights in that part of the Himalayas.', 'The idea behind this initiative is that the locals want to take control of the tourism in the area they belong to. And, MS ensures that local culture and way of life is showcased to the tourists.', 'In order to get the local boys and girls involved, MS started with training them at the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) at Uttarkashi to become local guides, porters and technical experts in search and rescue operations during trekking expeditions in the Garhwal Himalayas. These locals are well versed with their homeland and its history and most of them are able to converse well with the trekkers.', 'The trained boys pledged that they will develop tourism as envisaged in the Nanda Devi Declaration, which chalked out the biodiversity conservation and eco-tourism guidelines in 2001. Says Kainthola: “The boys who currently operate full time with Mountain Shepherds have eventually become partners in Mountain Shepherds”.', 'And how is that? MS started as a co-operative initiative but since the local youths wanted to become a part of the initiative and own the company, six years later Kainthola decided to convert the organziation into a Private For-Profit Orgaization and the boys, majority of whom are Bhotiyas, own 12 per cent of the company.', 'Today, MS has built capacities of more than 70 youth (boys and girls) from remote areas in a variety of skills necessary for responsible tourism in the Himalayas ranging from search and rescue operations, emergency medical response, life saving techniques, trekking guides, yoga and cooking.“The core team of Mountain Shepherds has 30 to 35 boys and around 18 of these work full-time with us,” says Kainthola', 'Talking about the performance of the company Kainthola explains that MS has guides and cooks accompanying trekkers.”In the first year, we had just about 15 tourists and earned Rs 60,000 to Rs 70,000,” he adds. In 2011-12, Mountain Shepherds had over 100 tourists and revenues of Rs 27 lakh.', 'Earlier, most of the trekkers were foreigners but now Indians account for half the number. The operating profit margins of the company are about 40 per cent, according to Kainthola. These profits have been used by the company to further expand to buy campsites in the region and also take a mountain lodge on lease at Auli which it has refurbished to call it Shepherds’ Devi Darshan lodge.', 'An interesting feature is that the tourists are given the option of choosing home stays owned by villagers or living in camps. This is an additional source of income for the villagers apart from direct sale of handmade carpets and woolen products and mule services for treks.', 'To further give the local community a boost, MS has also started an e-commerce portal called ‘Angwal’ through which it sells ethnic handicraft products, local spices and herbs, and local language books. “We have made a beginning and the response has been good. But, it will take a while to establish itself,” says Kainthola.', 'When MS talks of community-owned tourism it has also made sure to minimize the ills of tourism. The first step in this direction has been to set up a systematic garbage management system. The exposure of local communities is increased through direct interaction with visitors and through participation in tourism fairs.', 'MS is not stopping just at these. In the last one year it has realized the need for more specific training in mountaineering such as emergency medical courses, global safety standards courses that is currently not offered at NIM. To this end, it has now set up its own institute called ‘The Nandadevi Institute’ to impart international standard training to the locals as well as the outsiders. The trainers are called from the US for specific courses. The courses are generally for 10 days and Rs 30,000 is charged. The institute is getting both local as well as foreign students.', 'Mountain Shepherds has thus transformed from a mere seasonal trekking company to become a good example for community-owned adventure tourism company.

No box gifts were allowed; only donations to the fund.\n2. The children from 8 homes in Chennai were invited to the wedding reception. They joined in the celebration just as the rest of us.\n3. The bride did not wear any silk clothes or expensive ornaments and the wedding followed a much-researched simple ritual attended by close relatives.', 'It sounds simple, doesn’t it? And yet it is so hard to actually execute! How does a bride tell her family that she does not want to get dressed up and that she wants to marry so that she can adopt? And that the groom wants to pay for the reception from his own pocket – not his parents’ or in-laws’? And that he says No to gifts? Thilak and Dhana waited almost 2 years to convince their family to do just that!', 'No, Dhana and Thilak were not in love when they first thought of marriage. You see, both of them are uncommon, a little odd. Dhana had been avoiding marriage, for her passion lay with animals and social work. Thilak had decided he would not marry for he was convinced that he could not find a companion who would share his social passion, his adventurous spirit, and his quiet spirituality. But Gods smiled at these two wonderful individuals and brought them together in a way that is so apt!', 'A little baby girl called Theresa played cupid in this couple’s life. Who is Theresa?

Then Dhana proposed to Thilak, a friend then, to marry her so that she could adopt the baby. Adoption homes try to find parents before the baby turns one year as children find it difficult to adjust to new homes as they grow up. Dhana could not convince her folks in time and Theresa was adopted by another set of loving parents. But the wedding fundraiser in June was in the name of Theresa Educational Fund commemorating the love that brought these two beautiful individuals together.', 'I have known Thilak for sometime now. I first ran into him at the India Against Corruption movement and thereafter discovered that Thilak had dedicated his life to the welfare of the underprivileged children. He is the co-founder of Sevai Karangal along with Nandan, which monitors and supports eight Children’s homes in the city of Chennai. The organization works with a difference: They don’t just donate. Rather, they ensure people engage with the homes and the children. The monthly social treks conducted by Chennai Trekking Club take Chennaiites to celebrate their birthdays at the Children’s homes or take the children out on joyful treks.', 'Thilak insists that what children need is attention and love more than anything else – a sense of familiarity, a joy. He raises funds for infrastructure – he had a block built at one of the homes when he noticed the rooms were cramped for the kids. He organized for water filters after he tested the water in a couple of the homes. He raises funds for their school books and stationery and uniforms. He raises funds for their education. He, along with other volunteers, organizes Diwali events at the homes. He also supports an Old Age home. Till date he has channelized close to Rs. 7 lacs to the various homes in about 4 years.', 'And he monitors closely if the money is being utilized effectively, if the children are being taken care of properly. I remember once I was travelling with him to a meeting, when he asked if I would accompany him to a surprise visit at a home nearby. We bought some goodies for the kids and dropped in. Thilak later explained that these sudden visits help him gauge the real situation and also keeps the pressure on caretakers at the homes.', 'Besides engagement and funding, the organization has set-up a mentorship project called Navigator, akin to the Big Brother Big Sister program in United States and workshops to improve creative skills in the children.', 'No, Thilak is not from any rich family. The poor guy shuffles his time between work and passion so that he can sustain himself as well as provide for his passion. Dhana is not a rich girl either. She is rich in her heart.', 'As these two ordinary citizens of our country took those seven steps to bind themselves in matrimony, they did more than that – they set an example for others to follow, they gave meaning to the structure called marriage, they brought hope in the lives of so many children, they brought faith back to cynical hearts. We salute their spirit and their ideals.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
