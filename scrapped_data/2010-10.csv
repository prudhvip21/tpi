They may not be aware they are learning, but they sure are aware they are having fun. When you have a good belly laugh with your siblings or parents or friends, that stays with you. And the great thing is that it comes so naturally…if we only let it.”', ' A Trust formed by the parents of children with special needs, driven by volunteers and supported by professionals, Kilikili aims at creating inclusive play spaces that will be accessible to all children, regardless of their ability which acts as a first step in creating a more inclusive, non-discriminative society.', 'Kilikili wants to create a society where all children, all people are respected for their unique abilities, where diversity is viewed as a social strength. In doing so Kilikili wants to modify the existing play spaces like parks in such a way that they can accommodate children with special needs. They have constructed unique play structures that are completely wheelchair accessible with a ramp, a merry-go-round and a slide along with other equipments such as wheelchair sand tables, safe swings, a sensory integration track, a tyre tunnel and an accessible basketball pole. They plan on creating more such structures throughout the city of Bangalore.', 'In their attempt to be self sustaining, Kilikili offers a range of consultancy services for offices, schools, institutions and play spaces in order to have inclusive play spaces. The various kinds of services comprise of Access Audits and Accessibility Solutions, Designing inclusive play spaces, Designing Play and Recreation Programs for children and Enhancing children’s participation.', 'Kilikili articulates its ideas of play spaces by asking the children with special needs, their peers, sibling, parents, teachers and other professionals what they think needs to go into the design of these play spaces. The design team then conducts a visit to the potential site and then works on converting the plan into action. Kilikili works with BBMP, the local Municipal Corporation of Bangalore to develop these play spaces. Kilikili also organizes school programs and other event like Family Day.\xa0 It organizes an Integration and Inclusion event that reaches out to children from special and regular schools. This aims at helping the children of all abilities learn to interact with each other.', 'The impact of an organization like Kilikili is not quantifiable. It can only be measured by the interest people take in it. Kilikili is a completely volunteer driven organization. It provides people with an opportunity to contribute to the society in a unique way. The parents of kids with special needs are also equally excited about the initiative. The children with special needs, who experience a direct impact, have different stories to tell.', 'To read the stories and know more about Kilikili, visit www.kilikili.org\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', ""Chandrika is a student in her 4th year of engineering at BITS, Pilani.

Even as the surrounding regions develop, Purkal’s inhabitants, a mere 5000, largely remain dependent on activities such as farming. Families rely on a low, single income in most cases and are unable to break free from this vicious cycle. Children do not have access to quality education, good role models and enough exposure. This is precisely what made Mr. G K Swamy and his wife Chinni step in, by establishing the Purkal Youth Development Society in this peaceful hamlet back in 1998. What was once a small organisation to help children with their studies is now a fulltime school, with the vision of overall wellbeing of the children.', 'It all started when Mrs and Mr. Swamy came to Purkal.\xa0 Mrs Swamy explains, “We left Mumbai to come here because in those days Swamy’s travels would take him away from home for almost 20-25 days in a month. He had become diabetic. There was too much stress in our life. We wondered whether going out to earn all the money to finally spend it was even worth it. Wouldn’t it instead be better to earn less or not earn at all, but to spend a simple and quiet life?” Adding to this, Mr. Swamy explains, “We began our life in a very interesting manner. We decided we’d not have a phone, a car or anything beyond our essentials. We’d never have any servants, we’d do as sufficiently as possible but now we do have everything we didn’t originally want to have and have been supported in our vision beyond words.”', 'Coming to Purkal was never a conscious decision. It was a series of incidents. Even today, the couple feels that they were led to Purkal. Initially, they were living in a rented place, not very far from Purkal. There, they decided to start helping children in education. Mr. Swamy explains, “We wanted to help children learn better and started teaching a few children in our house. I taught the first batch. The next year, when we had another batch, my wife cooked and fed the children, and also taught the new batch.”', 'If it is destined, one thing leads to another. So was the case with this couple, driven to serve a larger cause. Mr Swamy humbly adds, “I don’t know whether we thought of this as our life’s work or our mission. We did think that we’d invest our best into the few children we had in the early stages. The few became many, not at my instance, but because many people thought that it was a good input that the few were getting. I remember in the first few months, a huge delegation of ten women whose children we were not teaching came to request us to take them in and help them improve. I couldn’t say no. It was only later that I realised that we didn’t have enough tables and chairs for the students! I remember looking around for some money and it is then that the first 4000 rupees offer came in, for the furniture!”', 'Today, PYDS has two important missions – to enhance the lives of disadvantaged rural youth through education and to empower women through skill development. The\xa0Yuva Shakti Programme (Youth Power) aims to provide holistic support to children and youth by providing access to quality education, mentoring and attention to nutrition and healthcare. In January 2008, Yuva Shakti began a new education scheme called ‘Bus Them to Purkal’. The programme takes very poor children from remote villages with no access to basic education, and literally buses them to Purkal to join the learning centre.', 'The\xa0Stree-Shakti Programme (Women Power) helps to create economic stability for women and to empower rural women by providing skill training and workspace to produce handmade home and fashion products. Poonam, a beneficiary has been working for Stree-Shakti for 5 years. She lives in the village of Ganesh Puri with her in-laws. Poonam’s sons 13 years old Aman and 11 years old Ankur, both study at PYDS. Her husband owns a small tea shop on the Mussoorie road. How has stree-shakti helped? Her in-laws explain, “We are a family of farmers. In old days, there was a lot of respect and money in farming but now times have changed. We are not able to produce enough even for the family. Since Poonam has started working, we are less worried. The problem is solved. If her children need anything, earlier we’d have to find a way to give them now she can take care of them.”', 'With the support of PYDS, many students have been able to complete their education and have even been provided scholarship assistance. Their mothers too, have been trained in skills such as handloom work.

Wages paid are in the range of Rs 2000 to Rs 5000.', 'Raghurajpur is known for its special type of paintings called the Patta Chitra. This is a traditional Indian painting form, which is done on cloth. The cloth is first coated with a unique mixture of chalk and gum and left to dry.

Recently, the campaign celebrated its second year with an opinion poll on early marriage organized at Shipra Mall, Ghaziabad. The call was ‘let the Girl Child be counted’. More than 200 people were sensitized against early marriage for girls. It was surprising that some of the most educated people wanted their daughters to get married by the age of 18 either due societal pressures or fear of mishap like rape, abuse, etc. Awareness drives and campaigns such as these can go a long way in truly educating the nation and making a difference in the way people perceive social problems.', 'For more details, visit http://www.smilefoundationindia.org', 'Or email info[at]smilefoundationindia[dot]org\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', ""Co-Founder of Serene Woods portal for authors and photographers, I have authored two books - 'Drenched Soul' (poetry) and 'If At All' (fiction).
