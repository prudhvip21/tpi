It was a committed revolution led by a couple, Bablu Ganguly and Mary Vattamattam, which has now transformed this land into an agro forest habitat. The unproductive soil was rejuvenated, rain water was harvested, trees were planted, crops were cultivated and the entire land blossomed.', 'Twenty years ago, Bablu and Mary set their foot on this barren land in the district of Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh. People had given up on this land, of which Bablu and Mary decided to buy 32 acres; probably the last thing one would expect from a young couple.', 'The spark that triggered this initiative was a book – ‘The One-Straw Revolution’, by a Japanese author Masanobu Fukuoka. The book carried a very special message on how humanity can live an enriching life hand in hand with the nature. Bablu and Mary carried this spirit and conceived their vision for this land that they called ‘Timbaktu’, meaning ‘Where the earth meets the sky’. Their aspiration was humble and they wanted to keep everything simple – get closer to the land and help it regenerate itself.', 'They knew there was potential in the land of Timbaktu which was once part of the rich and powerful Vijayanagara Kingdom. Its forests were considered to be the finest, its fruits were savored across the country and various armies fought to keep control of this once fertile land. But everything was destroyed by ruthless deforestation and use of environmentally damaging pesticides and fertilizers.', 'Over the years, villages in this region have been tormented by chronic drought, unproductive land, unemployment\xa0and poor infrastructural facilities. Bablu and Mary decided to build the Timbaktu land by engaging with the villages around and formed an NGO called The Timbaktu Collective. “Our vision is to stop the degradation of the land in Anantapur district and to find\xa0ways to reverse it. We want to green the hills and the land. We want to develop alternative lifestyles. Lifestyles that are sustainable and provide more liberty and happiness, than those based on exploitation. The farmers see their land degrade and the wells drying up, but they don’t know what to do, so they just continue their patterns of self-destruction. We want to find a path that leads out of this vicious circle, not without but together with them” – they say.', 'In 1991, the couple decided to put their first crop in the land of Timbaktu and as everyone around them said, the crop failed. That became even more instigating – Bablu went ahead and bought 7000 saplings. He and Mary brought farmers from the villages to build creative water harvesting structures ensuring that every drop of water was judiciously used. Seed dibbling and such traditional farming methods were practiced – and the colour of the land started changing. Timbaktu was transformed from a barren earth to a lush green forest. It’s heartening to see that birds, snakes and butterflies have come back to Timbaktu and a lost glory is reinstated. This is a true success story of eco-restoration and the experiment is being replicated with community support in a 10,000 acre waste land named as Kalpavalli.', 'The Timbaktu Collective grew to become a 105 member strong team who serve over 140 villages in Chennekothapalli, Roddam and Ramagiri mandals of Anantapur district. The organization runs two schools, one of which is a residential school for children from disadvantaged families. There is also a thrift credit system for the women which has now grown into a well established alternative banking system. Farmers in the villages are given training in organic farming methods and the Collective supports a Cooperative Society that assists the farmers in marketing their organic produce. With youth development, child rights activities, helping the disabled, cultural activities and many such programmes, the Timbaktu Collective has changed the face of humanity here.', 'Bablu and Mary stay in Timbaktu, in a house that is built with mud, built by them and built using things available in the land of Timbaktu. Their children studied in the school run by the NGO for the villagers. Their organization has made a difference to the lives of over 12,500 marginalized families. How much more purposeful can their lives get? How much bigger role models do we need to start doing our bit for the world around us?', 'Visit Timbaktu to know the true spirit of this land.

1,2010-6,"['Archives', 'Invention: Pin Pulverizer by Mr. Vivekanandan']","['In this article we bring to you an interesting invention by Mr. Vivekanandan, who is now being mentored and assisted by the Villgro foundation. Going by the good old adage ‘necessity is the mother of invention’, the device was invented by Mr. Vivekandan because of a real-world problem that his fellow villagers faced.', 'Chili and coriander powder are so central to South Indian cuisine, that village residents will travel 25 km by bus to get it ground.  They are forced to do this because the existing machines to grind chili and coriander are usually very large, have high installation costs, and use too much power to be suitable for rural areas.', 'Mr. Vivekanandan’s innovative solution was a pin pulverizer that was modified for small capacities, yet could still grind chili and coriander.  The material is centrally fed into the pin pulverizer’s milling chamber, which consists of two discs with pins: one is stationary and the other is rotary.  The material that passes through the space between the stationary and rotary pins gets scissored, and converted into a fine powder.  The perforated screen at the bottom filters the powder, and it is discharged through it.', 'When Mr. Vivekanandan applied to Villgro, pin pulverizers that could grind spices were already being manufactured with a capacity of 150 to 4000 kg/hr.  A pin pulverizer that had a capacity of 30 kg/hr was also available, but it was only able to grind cereals.', 'Mr. Vivekanandan’s journey with Villgro literally began with a journey.  He came to know about Villgro and its activities when he accidentally met an employee of Villgro on a train.  At this point Mr. Vivekanandan had already invested Rs. 8 lakhs (approximately US$ 18,700) of his own money, and had created a 3 HP pin pulverizer without any external help.  He thought he had solved 90% of the problems in grinding chili and coriander, and had manufactured 100 machines.  But of these only 20 were sold.  Even worse, three quarters of these machines were returned because the chili and coriander did not pass through the screen, and because they created too much dust.  The work came to a standstill, and did not resume until almost a year later, when he was introduced to Villgro.', 'Villgro tapped several different resources to work on this problem. These were the technical expertise of their own staff, the assistance of a consultant from TANSTIA-FNF, Mr. Ashok Iyengar, and InnoCentive, an “open innovation” company that opens up research and development problems for anyone to solve.  The solution arrived at was to increase the speed of the rotor to 6600 rpm.', 'While increasing the speed of the rotor is a seemingly simple solution, for Mr. Vivekanandan the key realization was that the chili and coriander were getting stuck in the screen not because of their high fiber content, but because of the speed of the rotor.  In addition, Mr. Vivekanandan was concerned that to run the rotor at higher speeds, he would need much more expensive bearings. Consequently, if the cost of the machine increased, then grinding chili and coriander could not become a viable income generating activity for rural women.  Mr. Vivekanandan is quick to emphasize that the main assistance that Mr. Iyengar provided to him was in giving him greater confidence, and in allaying his fears.', 'Mr. Iyengar first assisted Mr. Vivekanandan in producing a 5 HP, 3-phase machine, because his machine could not initially be run at the increased speed on 3 HP.  However as in rural areas the preference is for a 1 HP, single-phase machine, Mr. Vivekanandan subsequently reduced his machine’s weight, wall thickness, size and diameter of the stator and rotor so that it is suitable for rural areas.  Mr. Vivekanandan has also attempted to bring the cost of the machine down to cater to rural needs by focusing on the types and amount of materials used.  However he has maintained the quality of the essential components such as the bearings and blades.', 'Below is a picture of a villager using the pin pulverizer. Fantastic innovation which is sure to benefit hundreds of villagers!\n\nNote about the Villgro Foundation: Villgro is a not-for-profit company empowering rural development by  identifying and incubating innovations that could be translated to market based social enterprise models thus impacting thousands of lives.

5,2010-6,"['Written by Rahul Anand', 'Zameen: Bringing an Agricultural Revolution']","['\nWe have all read and heard about farmer suicides, pesticides in food and issues of child labour. Here is an organization that is working towards the eradication of all of these – Zameen.', 'Zameen is a unique farmer owned organic cotton trading company working to improve market access for marginalized farmers in India through certification, supply chain partnerships and organizational development.\nCotton farmers in India do not receive a fair price for their produce which leads them to usurious money lenders. Huge debt and inability to support their families leaves suicide as the only dignified option. In the Amravati district of Maharashtra, 5000 farmers commit suicide every year and that is an alarming statistic.', 'Zameen believes in the ‘trade, not aid’ approach to rural development. Farmers invest their own capital in Zameen and are completely engaged in the process. Zameen has a tie up with AOFG (Agriculture and Organic Farming Group), a non-profit organization, to facilitate the development of independent, legally registered farmer cluster associations that are self managed and are able to sell organic cotton as per strict international standards.', 'Infamously referred to as ‘dirty cotton’, the commodity accounts for 16% of global insecticide use which is far more than any other crop. Agro-chemicals contaminate local water supplies, degrade soil quality and harm wildlife. Farming communities also face an increased risk of various diseases like cancer. Zameen trains farmers in organic farming which has resulted in drastic improvement in soil fertility and farmers’ health.', 'As a Fairtrade certified organisation, Zameen farmers are no longer subjected to widespread speculation and fluctuation in market prices. Fairtrade guarantees a minimum price which covers sustainable farming and living conditions.

6,2010-6,"['Archives', 'Saffron Tree: Book Reviews and Literary Resources for Children']","['Ever wondered what books would be great to read to your children? Especially the younger ones? While there are some wonderful books in the western publishing world, where are the Indian children’s books that could give your child the much desired multi-cultural flavor, especially if you are residing abroad? Enter Saffron Tree – an initiative that discovers and reviews gems in Indian children’s literature. Saffron Tree does the work of figuring out what books you should be reading to your child. All you need to do is read their site!', 'The Better India was privileged to have an e-mail exchange with Praba Ram, the founder of Saffron Tree. Here is what Praba Ram has to say about Saffron Tree and the thoughts behind it:', 'I immediately knew I had to share with the world, the wonderful multi-cultural and multi-lingual gems, both from India and the U.S. Saffron Tree was born in October 2006 when my older daughter was four years and my little one, just four months old. The name was born out of imagination, simply to imply that books are as precious as the exotic spice, saffron and the more, the merrier indeed! I have always believed in the positive benefits of exposing children to books early on, mainly from studies and research showing how infant and toddler brains can soak up information like spongesAlso,discovering the joys of reading with a child through a multitude of children’s books that kids growing up today have access to – a truly pleasurable experience,\xa0indeed. Reading to children brought out the inner child in me, and made me realize seeing the world through the eyes of children can be very rewarding to adults too. It makes you pause, take a step back amidst the busy and hectic lives you lead, and enjoy the delightful moments you share together reading.', 'The best part about blogging is that it also gives us a wider forum to interact with a group of other like-minded individuals who are as passionate as I am in exposing their children to good quality children’s books. The tree slowly branched out and has been growing with the love and support of like-minded parents who are equally interested in reading eclectic children’s literature. Today, we stand strong as a team of sixteen blogger reviewers.', 'How difficult is it to find children’s books written by Indian authors? Who are the well-known ones and is there anything being done to promote this genre?\nPraba: It’s truly a breath of fresh air in the world of Indian children’s publishing. Today, there are some excellent independent children’s book publishers working to promote authors and illustrators and  create books with modern Indian sensibilities, while also being sensitive to the needs of children living in both rural and urban India. And there are veteran publishers such as Children’s Book Trust, National Book Trust, Rupa etc. with years of publishing experience, who have promoted gems like Ruskin Bond. Also, there has been a new wave of international publishers that have entered the Indian publishing scene. All these put together, I have little doubt in my mind that finding good, quality books would be a challenging task. If someone is interested, we have the names of all the popular Indian publishers listed on our website.', 'How do you select appropriate books to read to your children? Do you screen them before introducing them to your kids? What are the things you look for?\nPraba: Going with the interest of the child is certainly one way to select books. For the really young in the baby/toddler.pre-school stages, there are plenty of board books and picture books that experts recommend. My guess is finding board books for babies on Indian themes might be a bit difficult, although publishers in India have recently started paying attention to this age group as well. Also, age appropriateness is an important aspect to consider. Most publishers would let you know that on their books and websites. Of course, what clicks with one child may not click with another, and that is perfectly fine. Little children typically tend to be volatile, but research shows that twenty minutes of reading aloud to children goes a long way in terms of benefits.', 'Which are the books children take to most readily and are easiest to learn from? Does Indian mythology feature high on their list?\nPraba: Interests change and evolve as children grow older. For the very young in the early childhood category (0 to 5), concept board books and picture books are always wonderful to introduce early. Sometime between five and seven, typically children here make their first transition from picture books to chapter books.  My guess is more complex genres like mythology, mystery, adventure typically click with children in the 7 or 8 plus age group, i.e. when they are more mature and fluent readers ready for advanced\nchapter books. Children also take to comics and graphic novels around that age. These are just general pointers, and they can vary from child to child. The key is to start reading to your children early on and expose them to a variety of genres. Thanks to the children’s libraries that have sprouted in India in recent times, we have seen some of the voids being filled in terms of picture and chapter books, both Indian and non-Indian available in plenty for the early childhood.', 'To check out the delightful world of children’s books, visit Saffron Tree’s website: www.saffrontree.org', 'And before we sign-off, here is letting you know that Praba is also an author of a recently published children’s book. It is titled “Dinaben and the Lions of Gir”. The book talks about the Asiatic lions of India and the community of cattle people called the Maldharis that live in the jungle with the lions. They have been co-existing peacefully for centuries. The book celebrates their lives and that of the lions of Gir. Sounds wonderful? It is!
