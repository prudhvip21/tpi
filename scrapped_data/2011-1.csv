She asked them, “Padhoge Kya?” (Would you like to study? ) The kids eagerly welcomed the opportunity and started reciting the alphabet. At the end, she bid them goodbye after distributing sweets without the slightest hint that this would begin a new chapter in her as well as the kids’ lives. She had started the class without the intention of continuing it the next day. However, when one of the students asked her the timings for the next class, she couldn’t resist teaching them again.', '“I couldn’t think of a reason in the world to reject that innocent invitation by a knowledge hungry kid to teach them’”, Jalnidh told us.', 'The people in her locality reacted in diverse ways. While most of them discouraged her, there were a few who gave her the necessary push. Unshaken by the disapprovals, Jalnidh kept her spine straight and told everyone that she prioritized imparting education over simply receiving it. There were also some benevolent people who encouraged both Jalnidh and her students by distributing sweets and stationary items.', 'Thanks to Facebook Jalnidh’s friends read about the noble cause and decided to volunteer. Few became guest teachers at the street school.', 'Éclair at Ludhiana taught these kids basic manners, proper hygiene, alphabet, rhymes, disaster management, dental hygiene and tooth brushing techniques. It also sensitized them about the ill effects of tobacco and other drugs. Most of all, Éclair taught them how to dream. It provided the stimulus that the kids and their parents needed. Many of Éclair students enrolled themselves in nearby schools.', 'Éclair now has expanded its branches to Amritsar, Ganganagar and Delhi as well. \xa0It has about 15 spirited young volunteers, mostly college students who teach poor kids in parks in the evenings. The curriculum is flexible and context based. Usually, the volunteers start with alphabet, English or Hindi, according to what is thought as suitable for the kids, for them to get enrolled in nearby schools.', 'The volunteers from Éclair want more people to join in and impart education to as many children as possible. Here is a brief about the concept, syllabus and other FAQs.', 'Éclair is a street school chain being run by college students in the states of Punjab, Rajasthan and Delhi. The concept is to involve high school students and college students in imparting education to street kids in urban areas, thus channeling their free time and enthusiasm to the strata which needs it.', 'All you need is a park, street kids and a bit of enthusiasm. You don’t even need a room!', 'After starting with the basic alphabet, the syllabus can vary according to the teachers and students. Counting and basic science is taught through innovative teaching techniques. More than elementary knowledge, these kids are \xa0taught practical skills that they need the most in the kinds of circumstances they live. Activities like how to cross road, knowing traffic lights, how to wash hands, how to brush are organized by the volunteers.', 'The aim is to reform the outlook of the kids – they now know what is it to dream and to aspire. Éclair volunteers are doing a good job filling their eyes with hope and empowering their lives with quality education.', 'Éclair plans to publish an SOP on “how to éclair” and reach out to vacationing school students who can start such small ‘eclairs’ in their community parks nearby. We definitely need volunteers who can start eclairing in their localities so that extensive coverage of street kids is achieved. If Kerala can achieve 100% literacy, why not other states.', 'While RTE after being enforced in 2011 will allow universal enrolment of kids in schools, éclair has already begun the groundwork for the same – convincing parents, motivating kids by providing elementary education in community parks.', 'Facebook:\xa0http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_158791800829306', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Since 1993, she has dedicated her life to the noble but onerous mission of rescuing unwanted and unclaimed newborn girls and giving them a secure home and future.', 'Today, Unique Home for Girls has 60-odd residents who call Prakash Kaur mother. “They are my own children,” the lady says. “They are never made to feel like abandoned children.”', 'As we walk around the home, it is easy to see that her claim is quite well-founded. Even as her ‘family’ expands and her responsibilities grow, Prakash Kaur’s fount of maternal compassion shows no signs of drying up.', 'She has touched the lives of many who’ve been cruelly shunned by their own. Siya was only a few hours old when she was found in a drain, wrapped in a black polythene bag. Reva was a newborn when her parents decided to dump her near the highway off Kapurthala. Razia and Rabiya were just a few days old when they were discovered in the fields outside Jalandhar.', 'These girls have all found shelter in Unique Home, where they now enjoy the real family experience that their pitiless parents chose to deprive them of simply because of their gender. The girls who live here range from the age of four days to 19 years.', 'Unique Home is run by a trust named after Bhai Ghanayya Ji, a disciple of Guru Gobind Singh. The trust aims to raise these children as healthy individuals and arm them with all the social skills and educational qualifications that they need to face life on their own terms. The girls could not have found a better person than Prakash Kaur for the job of providing them with support and succour.', 'Most of Unique Home’s inmates arrive here as hapless, barely alive foundlings. So they have no recollections of how they are brought here. But those that have grown up in the life-affirming warmth of this home are proud that they belong here.', 'Under Prakash Kaur’s care and tutelage, these girls are all well adjusted individuals willing and able to take their rightful place in a society that still seems to harbour a strong aversion to children of their gender.', 'Prakash Kaur is acutely aware of the challenges that lie before her, but she has faith. “Yeh uparwaale ka kaam hai. Jab ussney yeh zimmedaari di hai to himmat bhi wohi dega. Jab aaj tak mujhe koi mushkil nahin aayee to aagey bhi nahin aayegi. Neki key kaam mein kabhi koi rukawat nahin aati,” she says. She is obviously getting on in years but she still retains the strength to make chapatis for all the inmates of the home three times a day and seven days a week.', 'The first thing that strikes one in Unique Home is a small hatched box near the entrance. It is called the “cradle”. Flip open the hatch and you see a shelf built into the wall. When a rescued child is placed on the shelf, it sets off an alarm that tells the staff that they have a new girl to take care of. When it comes to christening the new arrivals, names are drawn from all the religions of India. So at Unique Home, girls have Hindu, Muslim and Christian and Sikh names and faith has no restrictions.', 'Although we visited Unique Home without any prior notice, Prakash Kaur ensured that we were made to feel at home. Not surprising at all coming from a lady who has dedicated her life to dispelling a bit of the darkness that engulfs Punjab, indeed all of India. The girls brought to Unique Home grow up with a sense of belonging. This is the only home they know.', 'For a home that houses 60-odd girls, the place looks a bit too small. The rather cramped space has limited amenities for the girls, including three small rooms that serve as bedroom, dining area and playroom, in addition to a small kitchen and an office for visitors.', 'The room that is meant for infants has three big cradles. Each has four to five babies sleeping in them. Unique Home has now acquired a new site and expansion plans are in place.', 'But living space is the least of the home’s problems for the hearts here are big. This is like a huge family where the older girls take care of the younger ones. We are told by the founder that the girls go to good English medium schools like Saint Mary’s in Mussoorie. A few have since been married into suitable homes. But Prakash Kaur’s responsibility does not end there.', 'She continues to keep a watch over the girls even after they are married. She fights for their rights if the in-laws prove to be difficult. Take the case of former Unique Home inmate Alka. When her husband died prematurely, her in-laws grabbed all her property and threw her out of the house. Prakash Kaur intervened and fought tooth and nail. She eventually managed to secure for Alka her rightful share in the family property.', 'So far Prakash Kaur has organised the marriages of 17 of the Unique Home inmates. While a few of these girls graduated from college before they got married, the remaining tied the knot after passing out of high school. However, several of the older girls here have decided not to marry and instead dedicate themselves, like Prakash Kaur, to the service of Unique Home.', 'April 24 is a very special day at Unique Home. It is the day when the children here collectively celebrate their birthday. A huge 100-kg cake is cut and the day is marked by much merriment. That apart, once every year, during the summer holidays, the inmates of Unique Home go on a trip to Darjeeling.', 'On our visit to the home, we ate lunch with the children. The food was simple but delicious: rice, chapatis and aloo gobhi. Prakash Kaur made fresh chapatis for all the 60 children.', '“We don’t want to give our kids up for adoption. People come to us but we refuse,” says Prakash Kaur. Although she did not give us any specific details, she told us that she knows of many cases in which adopted girls have been ill treated.', 'Prakash Kaur herself has no idea who her parents were. She was found abandoned and grew up in a Nari Niketan. She describes the work she does today as “the lord’s work”.', 'Asked if she ever faced any mistreatment in the Nari Niketan where she grew up, she smiles and says: “I will never allow my daughters to work as maids anywhere.”', 'The most essential part of this home is that the children are aware of the fact that their real parents have abandoned them because they are obsessed with boys. But this poisonous truth has only strengthened their resolve to prove themselves. Sheeba, who studies in a convent school in Mussoorie, wants to be a successful neurosurgeon.', '“I want my real mother to know that the daughter she threw out of her life is well established. I want to be very famous. I want to prove to her that girls are not a burden,” she says. Sheeba has always stood first in her class with A-plus grades. She is determined to make it to a good medical college.', 'Lucy is 19 years old. She wants to be a professor of English. “I believe that education is the only way forward in this society which discriminates against girl children,” she says.', 'Punjab has one of India’s most skewed sex ratios. The percentage of women in the state’s population keeps dipping every year. A growing shortage of marriageable girls has forced men here to find partners in different cultures and states.', '“When French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni came to India, they prayed for a boy. I was shocked. I used to think that Westerners treat both genders equally. He could have asked for a girl. It would have sent out a message to the people of India. It’s rather sad,” says Prakash Kaur. The French first couple prayed for a son at the Fatehpur Sikri dargah of Sufi saint Salim Chishti.', 'Female foeticide is on the rise, especially among the educated class and in higher strata of society. It has assumed alarming proportions. According to NGOs working with issues related to women, every year, 10 lakh cases of female foeticide take place in the country with the help of gender determination tests. The death of young girls in India exceed those of young boys by over 300,000 each year and every 6th infant death is specifically due to gender discrimination.', 'According to Anjalee Shenoy of Sama Resource Centre for Women and Health, new techniques like PGD (pre-implant genetic diagnosis), a method that involves producing embryos through IVF, cannot just help you decide the gender of the child but the colour of skin and hair. And there is no effective law in place right now to stop this practice. “This falls under the Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994, but it is going undetected,” says Shenoy.', 'But there is hope yet. If only Prakash Kaur’s selfless spirit would rub off on society at large.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
2,2011-1,"['Archives', 'Village Women As Radio Jockeys']","['\n\n\nby\n\nAnjali Singh\n\n\nJanuary 21, 2011, 6:29 am \n\n\n', 'The moment Rachna, 19, steps behind the microphone she is a changed person. A radio jockey, she loves to communicate with her listeners on the community radio station in Lalitpur, a district in the impoverished, drought-affected Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh (UP), India’s largest state. Now a role model for girls in her village, she remembers a time when she was not even allowed to leave the house without a male escort. Today, of course, Rachna’s voice is heard in every home in the remote corners of Lalitpur.\n', 'Similar sentiments are echoed by Uma Yadav, 33, a housewife, mother-of-five and one of the 12 community reporters at the station, “Until now no daughter-in-law in the village had ever taken to reporting, recording programmes and getting involved in solving issues related to women. Initially, my family members refused to give me permission but once they realised how productive the work was, they relented. I still have to face the snide remarks of my sisters-in-law when I leave for the station every day and return in the evening, but I feel it’s a small price to pay for what I want to do.”', 'So committed is Yadav that after completing her daily chores she is motivated enough to walk three kilometres to reach the Lalit Lokvani office in Alapur to anchor shows and hold discussions on issues like breastfeeding and mother and child nutrition, which are two concerns that need immediate attention in Lalitpur.', 'Both Rachna and Yadav are part of a new communication revolution that has swept rural UP in the form of the much-needed Lalit Lokvani, the first community radio station in the state. In September, with the click of a button on the console, Ranvir Prasad, District Magistrate of Lalitpur, and Jugal Kishore, Joint Director of Bharatendu Natak Akademi and well-known theatre personality, made history by launching the radio service to reach over 80 villages.', 'What makes this radio station unique is the fact that it has encouraged women from within the community to take to reporting and anchoring programmes on issues that concern them. These focused scripts – that are usually written with women in mind – draw tremendous responses, especially because it uses the typical Bundelkhandi dialect.\n', 'The community radio station had begun in 2007 by narrow casting programmes to a few villages. The station received its wireless operating licence (WOL) in August 2010, which allowed it to officially broadcast on a frequency of 90.4 megahertz to villages within a span of 15 kilometres around Lalitpur.', 'Says Ram Krishna of Ideosync Media Combine, who has trained the 15-member Lalit Lokvani team, “The community radio is a powerful medium that gives people a chance to speak to the government directly. Even when we were narrow casting, the reach was tremendous but now the service will give a boost to the process of skill building among the people of Lalitpur. And when women motivate women by using the power of technology, the impact is phenomenal. Another advantage is that thanks to mobile telephony people can listen to programmes in privacy and call in and express themselves as individuals on any subject they wish to discuss. And for the adolescents – a potentially large listener base – there is huge scope to communicate through this medium.”', 'An initiative of UNICEF Lucknow, Sai Jyoti, the NGO that runs the station, and Ideosync Media Combine, community radio is being pegged as an important means of community outreach in UP, a state where the people have been facing multiple problems for decades.', 'But can these young women radio jockeys make community radio the powerful tool of information dissemination it is made out to be? Explains Rachna Sharma, Behaviour Change Communication Specialist, UNICEF Lucknow, “In the three years that Lalit Lokvani had been narrow casting to the villages it demonstrated what a powerful tool community radio is. The women anchoring these shows focus not only individuals shaping lives of people but also facilitate a more horizontal spread of information. This is ushering in a remarkable change in behaviour and attitudes, something that is very relevant in Lalitpur since a number of integrated government development programmes are located here. It thus provides the best convergence base for community development efforts.”', 'Adds Mridul Srivastava, Station Director, Lalit Lokvani, “CR reflects the real voice of the people. It is a service that caters to the interests and needs of a certain area, its culture, craft, cuisine and above all social and development issues. It has also helped mobilise women, who have become an integral part of this initiative. Most of our programmes have participants from within the community, including women who present shows keeping in mind the Bundelkhandi language and tradition. Issues like breastfeeding, the care of newborns, general health, hygiene and sanitation, nutrition, child marriage, child rights and education are covered.”', 'But running a radio station is not cheap and Lalit Lokvani has to generate Rs 70,000 (US$1=Rs 44.3) every month to keep going. While UNICEF Lucknow plans to support the station until 2012, the team at Lalitpur has already started working out ways to generate money with on-air advertisements.', 'Says Ram Krishna, “Programmes are broadcast for an hour every morning from 7 to 8 am, with two repeat broadcasts – 1 to 2 pm and then 5 to 6pm. Now we have managed to keep aside five minutes for airing ads, which can double up as the station’s remuneration. Talks are already on with the district administration, which is keen to disseminate information about government schemes being run for people. They feel community radio is a good medium for this. And since women figure as a major chunk of the team, government agencies find it doubly relevant to use this as a platform to educate and create awareness among the community on issues of women and child welfare.”\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

KCC enables farmers to have direct discussions with the subject matter experts who are able to analyze the problem effectively and provide the solution directly. \xa0\n\nA central call centre has been established which takes queries of farmers and answers in their language from 7 am to 7 pm, seven days a week. The MIS software captures callers’ details and specifications of the query which helps in analysing area-wise and crop-wise details within a time space framework and provides preventive, advance action solutions. It also identifies pest attacks in any particular geographical area and the information collected is provided to the State Agriculture Department for taking timely action by broadcasting on television, radio and other mediums. During the drought of 2009 Kharif, and untimely floods in October 2009, KCC was transformed into a control room providing preventive solutions to reduce crop damage on an area-specific basis across Madhya Pradesh.', 'The KCC Model has helped expedite farmer query redressal by almost three times compared to its predecessors.

Elementary education has been made compulsory for the children in our country, but what if they still want to study when they grow up and what if they do not have the resources to study?', 'The parents who do not send their children to school can generally be classified into two groups (a sweeping classification perhaps, but both these groups are large enough to be addressed) – one group comprises of those who are ignorant, who have no idea, no knowledge about the huge change education can bring in their life and their children’s future. The other belongs to the class of economically backward people, who can not afford to send their children to school. But with the upcoming education related laws and rights and efforts of the many, the roots of primary education is getting well-grounded (and we hope will take off as per plans!). However, at a later stage, when children grow up education is not free and there are many who bend their paths as per their financial needs. German Philosopher Erich Fronn had once said “Why should a society feel responsible only for the education of children, and not for the education of all adults of every age?”', '\nEvery individual in this society has a story to narrate, some moments to re-live, some past experiences that has turned their lives and there are some great people who have transformed their past experiences into an opportunity for others.

He believes that “The first expression of love is to serve” and says “Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, you’ll find one at the end of your arm. As you grow older you will discover that you have two hands. One is for helping yourself and the second for helping others”.

The student went on to excel at academics and now is a successful software engineer. One good wish from the family’s relative made this possible. Having understood the pain and trauma of what he went through, the engineer set his aspirations focused on providing education and financial support to the meritorious poor students.
