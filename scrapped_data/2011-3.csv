But last year her community voted to send her on the trip of a lifetime, all the way to India, to spend six months learning to become a solar engineer.', '“We were very proud,” Okasia says. “We learned about solar power and it is now working everywhere here.”', 'Okasia is one of a growing number of women from across Asia, Africa and Latin America who have participated in Barefoot College’s international solar program. (Read our previous article about Barefoot College.) The women travel to the small town of Tilonia in the desert state of Rajasthan to learn how to be solar engineers, and how to train others to do the same.', 'Bunker Roy founded Barefoot College in Ajmer, in 1972. He says that there are only two conditions for acceptance to the program: that the women are older than 45, and that they are illiterate.', '“Once we train an illiterate woman, they never forget what they’ve learned,” says Roy. “We find that literate women tend to forget because their mind is so cluttered. With illiterate women, we find that when we visit them in their villages after a few months, they haven’t lost their knowledge.”', 'A grant from the Indian government pays for the women to come to India for six months and learn how to build, repair and maintain solar lighting systems. Their communities purchase the basic equipment at a subsidized rate from an Indian solar power company.', 'Roy says Barefoot College’s program makes communities more independent. It also elevates the roles of older women. Choosing students between the ages of 45 and 55 – grandmothers in name or in fact – is key to making the program effective.', '“We’ve found men are quite untrainable,” he says. “They are restless and ambitious. They want a certificate, and as soon as they get it, they move to cities looking for work. Grandmothers are not interested in a paper to hang on their walls. They stay in their communities. Also, they have the patience to be great trainers.”', 'The programme was so successful in India that Roy decided to go international. \xa0Since 2005, Barefoot College has trained 200 women from Africa. Those women have brought solar power into 12,000 houses in 160 villages on the continent.', 'Loda Okasia says that since she has returned to her village, she has been maintaining the 200 solar lanterns that were distributed to her neighbors. \xa0The college’s local partner, the NGO Mifumi, pays her the equivalent of 17 euros a month for their upkeep. More and more people in Okasia’s community are asking for solar technology.', '“With it, we don’t have to buy paraffin [for oil lamps],” says Okasia. “Nobody works here. Buying paraffin is not easy. We are happy with solar.”', 'According to Roy, “the future is south-south cooperation. We can exchange practical knowledge and skills at the community level. We can learn things from Africa, and Africa can learn from us. This is community-to-community knowledge sharing.”', 'As for Loda Okasia, she says that her only complaint about her training in India was the spicy food. Otherwise, she is happy with her new skills. Now, she says, she wants to build a solar workshop so that she can assemble and repair more solar tools for her village.', 'Dear readers: If you have come across any such ideas or ventures that you believe we should write about, please feel free to mail us at contact [at] thebetterindia.com.\nAlso, get positive news delivered directly to your mailbox by subscribing to our e-mail alerts.\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
1,2011-3,"['Archives', 'From Fields to a BPO in just Six Months']","['\n\n\nby\n\nHemlata Aithani\n\n\nMarch 25, 2011, 11:56 am \n\n\n', 'Just six months ago, Puja, 18, and Bimla Devi, 35, spent their day cooking meals, tending to cattle and working in the field – the everyday work of village women across Haryana. Never in their wildest dreams had they imagined that they could one day be sitting in an office working away furiously in front of a computer.', 'Today, this is the remarkable reality of hundreds of women in Tikli and Aklimpur villages. Their agrarian way of life has not changed – they still cut fodder for their cattle and clear the cow dung – but they are now equally adept at using a computer. They work in a Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) centre, which has set up shop in the heart of their village. A first-of-its-kind women-only rural BPO in India, this centre was started by ‘Harva’, which stands for harnessing value of rural India.', '“I never thought I would be able to work on a computer. It was a big thing for me. But now working on the keyboard comes so easily to me. We come here for eight hours and do our job. I’m so proud of myself,” says Puja.', 'And how did these simple women get the hang of using a high-tech device like pros? It’s all thanks to a three- to four-month rigorous training course. Bimla can now type 35-40 words a minute, can mine relevant pieces of information from a pool of data and can do data entry perfectly.', 'But accomplishing this was not easy. Getting these women to step out of their homes was no mean feat. It took a lot of persistence to get them to break the rigid cultural and social barriers of their male-dominated society. It was the persuasive powers of Ajay Chaturvedi, a banker, who is a business management graduate from the University of Pennsylvania and an engineer from BITS Pilani, that worked like magic on these women. “When we heard of Ajay’s proposal we were elated that we would be trained and get jobs,” recalls Puja.', 'So it all began six months back with 500 women, who were selected to be trained in computer basics. “Irrespective of their formal education, they were selected for their ability to read and write, and some basic understanding of the English language, apart from their willingness to learn,” says Chaturvedi.', 'Training was provided free-of-cost and during the course they learnt about office culture and etiquette, basic English and communication skills, apart from Microsoft Office computer applications. Initially this was difficult for them, recalls Archana, 29, who has a 12-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son. “We were shy, a bit hesitant and all of a sudden had to deal with machines and technology. But gradually, with training and motivation, we picked up fast,” she says.', 'Their determination not only got them through the training but they were rewarded with short-term employment. Out of the 500 women initially selected, 200 completed the course and 50 were deployed on various projects. Twenty women are still working on projects, which involve data mining, while 30 more women are likely to get work as new projects come in.', 'While the opening of the BPO has created jobs for these rural women, Chaturvedi emphasises that this is in no way an NGO (non-government organisation) project, which aims at social welfare and plays less attention to accountability. He believes that the only way to better utilise the rural India market is through “socio-capitalistic business models”.', '“This is a business venture with a conscience and social responsibility. I am a capitalist, who would see whether a business model is viable and profitable or not. After ensuring this, the social cause can be served. If I create value, create business and opportunities, it will benefit everyone, including the villagers,” says Chaturvedi.', 'He also frankly admits that he did not employ the women out of charity. “Women are overall superior beings, far more hardworking and serious. They can do a job in half the time that men can. They are good at multi-tasking and efficient and can work at a stretch without taking breaks, whereas men tend to always take many small breaks during work hours,” he says.', 'Chaturvedi proudly gives the example of a 25-year-old woman – a Class VIII graduate – who learnt all the characters on the computer keyboard in just three hours, “something that is not easy even for people like me,” he smiles.', 'Interestingly, the BPO centre is not Chaturvedi’s only rural venture. This entrepreneur left his lucrative job with Citi Bank to tap rural talent and opportunities. He has already dabbled in community farming for non-rain-dependent cash crops in Uttarakhand. He wants to expand this project to 10,000 acres across the country that will benefit 10,000 farmers in the next four to five years. He has also been providing credit to rural people through micro-financing. Waste management is his upcoming project.', 'But for now, he wants to take this BPO model to other villages after seeing its success in Tikli, Aklimpur and surrounding villages. He has six other states\nIn mind and has already laid the groundwork to open a centre in Bihar and Uttarakhand.', 'Working at the BPO centre has helped to enhance the image and status of women in a state notorious for its skewed sex ratio and masculinised culture. It has proved to be their ticket to economic freedom, even though in a modest way.', 'Bimla, mother of a girl who is in Class VII and a boy in Class II, was over the moon when she received her first salary of little over Rs 2,000 (US$1=Rs 44.6). “Whatever little amount I got, it was mine. It was a result of my hard work and I realised its worth,” she says.', 'Adds Suman Devi, 28, a mother of two, “We feel economically empowered. It gives us a sense of security. We spend the money on ourselves and contribute to household expenditure, apart from saving some for the future.” Reena, 18, the most vocal of the lot, gives her take: “I feel city people always think rural women are illiterate and uncultured. But now we have proven them wrong. We are educated and all we need is just an opportunity. Since the villagers know we are getting salaries every month, they too want to send their girls and daughters-in law over here.”', 'The last six months spent at the BPO have made them better with time management and multi-tasking. “Earlier we used to spend the entire day in doing household chores. But after joining the BPO, we finish all our work by 10am, come to office, work here and go back for the evening chores,” says Bimla.', 'Apart from being a source of their financial independence, the BPO centre has become a place for these women to make friends. Now they have their own space amidst 20 computers in this two-room centre nestled among sprawling fields. “We have bonded really well. During our breaks we share our happiness and sorrows, married life, problems and issues, at home or outside. It gives us a lot of emotional support,” says Manju Yadav, 25, who has a daughter.', 'All they want now is some sustainable long-term projects, which would guarantee them regular work and income. But for the time being they are enjoying their new avatar, and ‘keying’ in their success story.', 'Note for readers: If you have come across any such ideas or ventures that you believe we should write about, please feel free to mail us at contact[at]thebetterindia.com.\nAlso, get positive news delivered directly to your mailbox by subscribing to our e-mail alerts.\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

This involves moving the hand over a space of one meter up and down around semi-circularly arranged pegs 9000 times (yes, 9000 times!) for one sari. For each sari to be completed it takes almost 4 to 5 hours.', 'Chintakindi Mallesham (37) was born in a small village of handloom weavers , Sharjipet (AP). His mother, Laxmi, used to do the Asu  that caused tremendous pain in her shoulders & elbow joints. Even though Mallesham didn’t have much knowledge in mechanical or electrical technology, a strong desire to relieve his mother’s pain egged him to achieve his goal.', 'Part by part he developed and fitted mechanical devices to a wooden frame. Because of lack of requisite skills, he ended up wasting his hard earned money many times. He used to go to Hyderabad to shop for relevant components. By observing different machine parts he managed to complete some portions of the machine successfully. His family was now fed up of his obsession of making \xa0Asu process, so he left the village to make a living in Hyderabad. Within a short while, the machine was almost ready except for one movement. He reached a blind spot where he had no idea which part to use for the action that involves the thread to go round the peg and slide down the last thread perfectly.', 'In feb 1999, he went to work in a machine shop in Balanagar area in Secunderabad. In one machine he noticed a movement similar to what he required. He took leave for the day and rushed to the workshop to get that component manufactured. With his heart in his mouth, he fitted the component in the machine and started the operation. The machine worked. His friend then used the Asu machine processed yarn to make a sari. The quality that came out was better than the hand woven Asu process!', 'The first machine was made in 1999, mounted on a wooden frame. Next year, the same was changed to steel. Now many electronic components have been added thereby increasing the functionality and flexibility of design. The Asu machine has reduced the time taken to weave a sari from 4 hours to just one and a half hours. This means that women in the village can now make 6 saris instead of 2 saris per day – earning more in the process.', 'Till date Mallesham has sold over 600 Asu  machines. His next dream is to develop a loom for weaving saris – this loom currently requires 3000 leg and hand movements over a period of 2-3 days. Mallesham has already developed a small prototype.

The atmosfair India Renewable Energy Innovation awards addressed in the article are a step in this direction.\xa0End of Update', 'In the Kolar district in Karnataka, a slow but radical transformation is taking place. The villagers are altering their source of energy. Century-old practices of using firewood for fuel and decade-old practices of using kerosene are being systematically replaced by sustainable and clean biogas. Innovative biogas digesters made from locally available materials are being implemented in a joint project between local NGO’S and – not international aid agencies – the German carbon offsetting company Atmosfair. Carbon credits provide the project partners with additional income, making the project feasible.', 'Carbon offsetting projects are mostly known as large scale ventures, prevailing in India and China, used by western countries to offset the emissions they cannot (yet) avoid. One major shortcoming of the majority of carbon offsetting projects is their limited demarcation of sustainability. As clean energy seems to imply sustainable development, social and economic aspects that should be taken into regard for a full picture of sustainable development are neglected. The wellbeing of people affected by the projects is barely regarded. This bleak picture, however, is not the full portrait. Though small in numbers, strong efforts are being made to guide carbon funding in the direction of people working on projects that make a difference; a daily life difference in the lives of people who need it most.  ', 'There is much controversy questioning the ethics of offsetting with the common argument that it is reinforcing business-as-usual energy use in western countries and obstructing real change. Further controversies involve incidents of forces relocation of local residents as land for renewable energy projects is required and carbon funding used to implement energy efficiency regulations in what remain highly polluting new energy plants.', 'In current debates on the transformation to a low carbon economy, sustainability is so strongly associated with renewable energy that the social and economic aspects of genuine sustainable development are drowned out. This is reflected in the nature of carbon offsetting projects that have highly meticulous regulations to ensure high standard implementation of renewables. Social and economic impacts are treated as an occupational hazard, tested superficially, if at all, in order to get the paperwork through.', 'Critique of carbon offsetting is not without reason, but there is a need to also highlight efforts of organizations within in the sector that aim to guide carbon funding in the direction of people working on projects making difference in people’s daily lives, driven by a holistic and encompassing view of sustainability.', 'In \xa0the Kolar district in Karnataka, Women for Sustainable Development and ADATS work together with the German carbon offsetting company Atmosfair to provide families with small biogas digesters, made of local materials. The digesters are fed agro-residues, mostly cow dung and the gas produced is used for cooking. This frees women from the cumbersome task of collecting wood and provides them with a much healthier cooking environment by heavily reducing the firewood smoke that causes Indoor Air Pollution.
