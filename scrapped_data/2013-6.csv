0,2013-6,"['Archives', 'How I Escaped A Snowstorm In Spiti']","['\n\n\nby\n\nYoginder Sikand\n\n\nJune 27, 2013, 1:08 pm \n\n\n', 'Yoginder Sikand was just settling in for some peace and quiet in a tiny hamlet of the deliriously scenic Spiti ecosphere, when he was hit by the recent snowstorm. Faced with the possibility of being stuck without food and warmth for weeks, he decided that he would try to get to a bigger town and seek help. But how was he to find his way, being completely foreign to those parts and terrains? Much to his wonder, a helping hand was always around!', 'Tabo was just the place I had hoped it would be – small, neat, quiet and unhurried, with wonderful views of towering mountains that pierced through the perfectly cloudless turquoise sky. You couldn’t have asked for a cozier place to unwind in Tabo than the little room that I managed to get in Champa Yeshe’s house, and at a very affordable charge at that. I decided I would spend a fortnight there, reading and writing and treating myself to a spell of well-deserved isolation, after which I planned to trot around elsewhere in Lahaul and Spiti, high up in the Himalayas in Himachal Pradesh, straddling the Tibetan border.', 'I had hardly settled down in Tabo – it takes time to get used to breathing at an altitude of almost 3300 metres above sea level – when torrential rains, followed by heavy snowfall, suddenly cut the village off from the rest of the world. Villagers couldn’t recall it ever snowing so heavily before in the middle of June, and they attributed it to global warming. In just a couple of hours, the flat-roofed, prayer-flag festooned houses of Tabo were groaning under thick layers of snow. The mountains that ringed the village, which, a day earlier, were stark naked, were suddenly transformed into giant towers of ice. Huge stretches of the road leading to Tabo from Kinnaur in the east, we heard, had been washed away, and it would take weeks, if not months, for the road to be restored. The road leading westwards, to Kaza, the only sizeable township in Spiti, too, was now impassable.', 'At first, I thought the snow bit was fun: after all, I hadn’t seen snow for years. But when the gently-falling flakes turned into something like an angry snowstorm and when I heard from villagers about the massive destruction and loss of life caused by the cloud-burst in neighbouring Kinnaur and Uttaranchal, I began to panic. No one had the faintest idea how long we would be stuck in Tabo. What if food and medical supplies ran out? stranded tourists began to ask. Already, the electricity supply had been snapped all across Spiti, and it was said that it might take weeks for it to be restored. Sitting in my dark, icy-cold room all day, huddled under a mountain of quilts while the snowstorm raged outside, I began to fear the worst.', 'Two days later, I determined I had to get out of Tabo immediately. At a village just ahead of Tabo, I met Krishan, a government employee who had to get to Kaza the next day for ‘election duty work’ – elections to the Mandi Parliamentary Constituency, of which Spiti was part, were due to be held in two days’ time – and he offered to take me along. From Kaza, he said, I could get a vehicle out of Spiti, and over the 4590 metre-high Kunzam Pass to Manali if the road had opened. We would set off, Krishan explained, early the next morning, well before sun-rise, so as to avoid the rocks that came tumbling down the slippery mountain slopes with the snow-melt when the sun was out. Being hit by even a small pebble rushing down a mountain hundreds of metres high could mean certain death.', 'I spent that night in Krishan’s home. Krishan’s aged mother plied me with a pillar of hot chapattis, plenty of vegetables and several rounds of tea, and chattered about her childhood and about how wonderful things were then. For a while, I forgot about the difficult journey ahead the next morning.', 'I tossed about in my bed that night, agonizing about what was to come. The road was ‘dangerous’, Krishan had said, and we would need to walk almost twenty kilometres till we crossed the bad stretch. A millions thoughts were running through my head.', 'Wasn’t escaping on foot sheer madness, I asked myself, especially since I had never walked such a distance before, and that, too, high up in the Himalayas? What if I slipped and fell, down into the valley far below? What if I developed breathing trouble? I was grossly overweight and under-exercised, after all. If almost all the other travelers stuck in Tabo were being ‘sensible’ by waiting for the road to be cleared or to be rescued, so they hoped, by helicopter, why couldn’t I do the same? Would today be my last day?', 'Who knows, I might well be dead before the day was over, I mused. But, I firmly said to myself, there was no way I was going back to Tabo. Yes, I determined, I was definitely going along with Krishan later that morning.', 'I climbed out of my bed and fiddled around with my bags. It would be impossible to carry all my possessions. I had to minimize and take with me only the bare essentials—a pair of pants, a couple of T-shirts, my laptop and camera and a few cosmetics, all of which I stuffed into a single bag.', 'At 4 am, when it was still dark and freezing, Krishan and I set off towards Kaza. The sky had cleared, and the rains had stopped. But I had hardly walked twenty minutes when the straps of my sandals suddenly snapped. They definitely weren’t made for rough terrain. I hadn’t brought walking shoes with me, expecting the weather in Spiti in mid-June to be summery. For a moment, I was terrified. I looked at the road ahead, strewn with huge jagged-edged boulders and enormous piles of rubble and slush, and my heart sank. I had only my bathroom slippers with me. Ordinarily, I wouldn’t have believed that I could walk even a hundred metres in them on that rough road, but at that moment I couldn’t afford to think and worry. I pulled out my slippers from my bag and put them on.', 'Krishan looked worried. “Maybe you should have stayed behind in Tabo,” he said. Perhaps he was right, I thought, but just for a second, for now there was no turning back.', 'I scrambled over the rocks with difficulty. Seeing me struggle, Krishan insisted on carrying my bag. I quickened my pace, rushing ahead as fast as my slippers would carry me. Krishan egged me on to hurry up. “Who knows when a rock can fall from above? It is really very dangerous,” he said.', 'Stretching high up on side of the narrow road were towering peaks, littered with giant boulders that had come sliding down in the storm. On the other side was a sheer fall into the Spiti river, that rushed far below. One wrong move and I could easily slip to instantaneous death. If my slippers gave way, there was possibly no way I could continue to walk, which might well mean being trapped in an avalanche.', 'I’ve never, I think, been so focused in all my life as I was that morning. My mind was firmly riveted on the road as I plunged ahead, racing over boulders and hillocks of slippery mud. Not for a single moment did I stop to rest—not even for a breather or a sip of water. I’ve never known myself to have walked even half a kilometre without a break, but now I rushed along non-stop, unmindful of the stones that cut into the sides of my feet, driven by a grim determination to reach safety. Strangely, I didn’t feel at all exhausted or breathless, and nor did I fall even once. It must definitely have been God who took me along that morning—I could never have done it on my own.', 'We covered eight kilometres in just under two hours, arriving at Sijling village, where we discovered to our immense relief that the rest of the road to Kaza had been cleared. A friendly villager invited us to his home for tea, butter-smeared parathas and a much-needed rest.', 'Later that day, Krishan decided to head for Kaza, while I planned to spend the night at the Dhankar monastery, perched high up on a cliff, and then hitch a ride the next day to Kaza and from there by taxi out of Spiti.', 'I didn’t know how to thank Krishan. He had brought me with him, had carried my bag and had hosted me for the night. Were it not for him, I would probably have been still stuck in Tabo. I would never have dared escaping Tabo on foot without him. I offered him some money. “It’s for your grandchild. Please buy a dress for her,” I said.', '“You think this is some sort of business or what?” Krishan replied, visibly hurt. “Whatever little I did for you was because you are a fellow human being.”', 'I gulped in embarrassment and gave him a hearty parting hug.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
1,2013-6,"['Archives', 'TBI Inclusivity: Unnati – Bridging The Gap Between Education And Employability']","['\n\n\nby\n\nAnusha Subramanian\n\n\nJune 25, 2013, 12:44 pm \n\n\n', 'Literacy rate in India might be cited at around 74% (in 2011), but the ground reality is that even among the so-called educated youth, ’employability’ remains a key challenge. The main reasons behind this are a lack of communications and other finer skills. This is an important gap that needs to be bridged, and we bring to you an organization in Bangalore committed to doing this from the past several years, with great success.', 'Suresh, 26, hails from Bidari, a small village in Karnataka and is the last of six children. His father is a farmer and his mother a homemaker. His family was dependent on the monsoons for their livelihood. Their family income was barely Rs 25,000 per annum. Suresh however managed to complete his BA from Gulbarga University and thereafter his BEd in 2009. Despite his education he was unable to get a job. The predominant reason for his rejection at interviews was poor communication skills and lack of spoken English. That’s when he was referred to Unnati by a friend.', 'He joined the 20th batch of Unnati in the BPO Vocation. He got his first job at Hi-data with a salary of Rs. 5000 per month back in late 2009. After a two-month stint, he joined Allsec Technologies as a customer care representative, representing Docomo with a salary of Rs 6000 pm, and he stayed on for 6 months. At Unnati he managed to work hard on his communication skills and spoken English and that finally got him a bigger job at STPI (Software Technology Parks of India). He worked here for 2 yrs as an admin support staff (contractor) with a salary of Rs. 8000 per month.', 'At STPI, he gathered some additional knowledge of the import-export foreign trade policies. Due to a change in Government policy, some small organizations could not afford to stay in the STPI & wanted to exit from the union. This meant a lot of forms needed to be filled & government processes needed to be completed. There was only one agency doing this, and they would charge exorbitantly. Suresh spotted this opportunity and started his own consultancy business-Raj Consultancy in this space. His first client gave him an incentive of Rs 15000 as the work that needed to be completed in 45 days was completed it in 35 days. Suresh now earns Rs. 25000 a month on an average. Next, Suresh is toying with the idea of starting a small human resource company to supply workforce to the BPOs.', 'There are many such inspiring stories of youth from underprivileged homes. Thanks to SGBS Unnati Foundation, a Bangalore based NGO that trains underprivileged unemployed youth to get employment.', 'It began as a small idea within the walls of a two-bedroom house in 2003 in Bengaluru when Ramesh Swamy launched the Unnati initiative with 50 donors under the Sree Guruvayurappan Bhajan Samaj Trust (SGBS).', '“We initially started to fund a few students when we realised that young people from poor backgrounds were in dire need of training,” says Swamy, who has his own logistics business. Explains Swamy:', 'Unnati which means progress in Sanskrit enables unemployed youth from economically weaker sections of society to get employed with a steady job, thus augmenting their family income, and standard of living.', 'From training 350 youths in the first 5 years of starting Unnati, the organization today has grown to become a large organization that has so far trained over 1800 underprivileged youth through the 70 days vocational training and social transformation programme it conducts.', 'How does Unnati operate? Dropouts aged 18 years and above, belonging to economically backward and weaker sections of the society are either recommended or hand-picked and given a 70 day vocational training without a break that spans across 9 vocations such as Retail sales, Field sales, Guest care – Hotel, Guest care – offices, Industrial tailoring, Entry level Voice & Data (BPO), Security services, Driving, and Industrial painting. The training is a mix of practical and theory classes. The various programmes have been designed with the help of industry, and people from these various industries and vocations also come and teach the youth.', 'The courses are designed in a such a way that the youth are not only trained in the vocation but are also socially transformed to become confident and good citizens. On successful completion of the training the youths are placed for employment with reputed firms that have a tie-up with Unnati Foundation. The foundation is open to both boys and girls and there is no academic criterion. Says Swamy:', 'Our country needs inclusive growth – the underprivileged and deprived sections of our society\xa0need to go miles before integrating within the mainstream. This is not possible only through gainful\xa0employment. Youth belonging to these sections need to be groomed to get acceptability in society.', 'He further adds that this happens through acquiring better soft skills, life skills, presentation skills, language skills, and general awareness of use of technology and value systems. It changes the profile of the youth enabling them to join the mainstream, along with a stable and sustainable income. In other words, in addition to imparting vocational skills, Unnati trains the youth in life skills, communication, spoken English and basic computer usage. Special attention is extended in inculcating personal and community values in the youth.', 'One of the best aspects of Unnati foundation is that the training is offered ‘free of cost’ to the youth along with food and shelter for outstation youth during its 70-day programme.', 'Unnati is able to bear all the expenses as it raises funds from donors both individuals and corporate. A donor can sponsor one youth for a cost of Rs 12,000.', '“What I am today has been possible only because of what I learnt at Unnati. Unnati has given me a career avenue that even my double degrees could not fetch me,” says Suresh. Most youth I spoke to at Unnati speak the same language as Suresh.', 'All of them credit their success and new lease of life to their learning at Unnati. They say that more than anything it has taught them to be confident and believe in themselves.', 'According to a McKinsey report released in December 2012, 53 per cent of employers in India feel that lack of skills is a common reason for entry-level vacancies. It’s understood from reports and sources that India needs an estimated 500 million skilled workers. And organisations like Unnati that trains approximately 600 youth every year are bridging a critical gap in India. Since inception, it has changed the lives of about 4,000 people.', 'Over the years companies such as Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, IBM, Akzo Nobel, Café Coffee Day, First Source, Life Style, Levis, TCS, Asian Paints, Cap Gemini, Gokuldas Exports, to name a few, have hired Unnati graduates repeatedly thereby establishing a relationship with Unnati.', 'The Unnati model is replicable and it is currently running centres in places like Delhi, Raichur, Chennai and Ahmedabad and soon plans to open a centre in Coimbatore. Going forward, Unnati Foundation’s 2020 movement aims to ‘train and employ 1 million underprivileged youth across the country’. It strives to achieve this mission by setting up 300 centres across India with 300 youth per centre through their motto Learn, Earn and Stand Tall.', 'Swamy is a happy and satisfied man today as his Foundation has made a difference and it has been able to transform the lives of so many youngsters.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
2,2013-6,"['Archives', 'TBI Special Report: The Bagariyas of Ajmer – A Little Bit Can Go A Long Way']","['\n\n\nby\n\nYoginder Sikand\n\n\nJune 21, 2013, 2:26 pm \n\n\n', 'The Bagariyas of Rajasthan are one of the poorest and least literate tribes in India. While they are barely eking out an existence, their children don’t go to school, they have no electricity, or in fact, any facilities that make life easier. Most developmental schemes seem to have bypassed them. But we see here, how a little money and a lot of initiative, can have a large impact on people’s lives.', 'For centuries they led a semi-nomadic existence, surviving mainly by hunting and guarding other people’s fields. Considered among the poorest and least literate castes in Rajasthan, most Bagariyas live in miserable little settlements outside villages, setting up their huts, made of baked mud, thorny branches and plastic sheets, on bits of barren land.', 'The dozen-odd Bagariya families who live on the outskirts of Kotri, in the north-eastern corner of the Ajmer district, are among the poorest inhabitants of the village. None of them owns more than a small parcel of land, compelling them to work as lowly-paid labourers or as guards in other people’s fields, in return for wages in kind. Some eke out a livelihood making coal from wild bushes. While several other inhabitants of Kotri have borewells and pumps in their fields, enabling them to grow two crops a year, no Bagariya can afford these. Most houses in Kotri have electricity, but not a single Bagariya house does. Although electricity poles have been installed near the Bagariya settlement, so far no Bagariya family has arranged for a connection to their home.', 'Living as they do on the fringes of Kotri, the Bagariyas have been almost completely by-passed in development schemes meant for the village. Says Chhotu Bagariya, ‘As long as I can remember, we never received any help from the government, except for two small toilets some years ago—planks of stone put together—which no one uses, and are now filled with dirt. It was only last year that we got forty-five thousand rupees under the Indira Gandhi Housing Scheme to set up pakka houses.’', 'The money sanctioned to the Bagariyas under the housing scheme isn’t sufficient to build the two-roomed structure that Chhotu is dreaming of making for his family of eleven members, including his nine children. ‘I’ll have to take a loan of some thirty-five thousand rupees to cover the rest of the cost, at a two per cent monthly rate of interest,’ he says.', 'Chhotu’s neighbor, Mangu Ram Bagariya, adds, ‘I’ve had to pawn my own and my wife’s jewellery to get a loan to cover the rest of the expense of building a pakka house. But the trouble is well worth it, because when it rains our mud houses inevitably cave in and collapse.’', 'Chhotu and Mangu have no idea how long it will take to repay the loans. It might even take several years. After all, their sources of income, like other Bagariyas’, are meagre. They own only a small patch of land, which yields just one crop a year, and that, too, only if it rains sufficiently – which isn’t at all definite in this semi-desert part of Rajasthan. They possess some goats, but not enough to generate much of an income for their families. They might have to spend two or three years working as labourers in the salt pans in the nearby Sambhar lake region to save enough to repay the debts they’ve taken to have the pakka house that they have long dreamed of. ‘Being in debt is nothing new for us, though’ says 22 year old Ugam Ram Bagariya. ‘Almost all the Bagariya families here are deep in debt, borrowing mainly from local moneylenders at high rates of interest. Sometimes, we borrow even simply to buy rations. My family has a debt of some two lakh rupees, which we had taken to arrange for a marriage in the family. We’ll have to spend years laboring to repay it.’', 'Despite being desperately poor, most Bagariyas have large families, with upto nine or ten children. Not a single Bagariya child studies in school. Only a few Bagariya children can somehow manage to read a few letters of the Hindi alphabet, having studied for a few years in a night school run by Manthan, a local people’s organization located in Kotri. But none of them is literate in the real sense of the term.', '‘Our kids simply sit around, playing in the mud all day or grazing goats,’ says Manna Devi, mother of eight. Adds Mangu Ram, ‘Some of our children began going to the government school, but after a few days they began to skip classes and then they stopped going completely.’ He points to a group of Bagariya children, dressed in tatters, their faces caked with mud, running about, and muses, ‘What is the use of going them going to school since in any case they aren’t going to get a government job?’', 'Says Teja Ram, coordinator of Manthan, ‘We have been trying to convince the Bagariyas of the importance of education, but we haven’t had much luck. Maybe their children, like most other village children, find the curriculum alien and boring. But at least the Bagaraiyas now send some of their kids to the crèche we’ve started in their locality. Who knows, these children might one day go on to join regular school.’', 'Some 20 Bagariya children attend the crèche daily. ‘At the crèche they get nutritious food and learn songs and games. But that’s not the only purpose that the crèche serves’, explains Teja Ram. ‘The two women, both from other castes, who run the crèche serve as a means to link the Bagariyas with the rest of the village. They interact closely with the Bagariya women, learn about their problems, provide them information about health-related issues and family planning and the like.’', 'Potable drinking water is a major problem in this arid region. Located near the rim of the giant Sambhar lake, a major centre of salt production, much of the underground water sources here are extremely high in salt content. The burgeoning salt industry has led to the drying up of village wells, increasing brackishness of available water and a sharp fall in the water table across the area, hitting vulnerable communities like the Bagariyas the hardest. ‘For decades we took water from two wells located close by,’ says Manna Devi, ‘but one of them is now dry and the water in the other, which was once sweet, is now too salty to drink. The water from the local hand-pump is also now full of salt.’', 'Till recently, the Bagariyas had no alternative but to drink the water from the hand-pump located in their locality, even though it is far too salty for human consumption. A recent intervention by Manthan, in association with Forrad, a Delhi-based organization working on water-related issues, has made a major difference in the lives of the Bagariyas in this regard. Under the innovative ‘Back to Basics’ programme, funds were collected from well-wishers for constructing water tanks (called ‘haud’ in the local dialect) outside each house in the Bagariya settlement. The cost of sponsoring one water tank, with a capacity of some 6000 litres, was around Rs.10,000. With this money, Manthan purchased the material necessary for the tank and paid the mason’s fee, while each Bagariya family provided the labour for installing their own tank. Work was finished in just a week.', 'Thanks to the ‘Back to Basics’ intervention, every Bagariya house now has its own haud, saving girls and women the onerous task of trekking a long distance to fetch water and the compulsion of drinking the harmful brackish water from the hand-pump that the Bagariyas once used to rely on. But although Manthan’s effort means a lot to the Bagariyas, each family still needs to spend some 350 rupees a month – a huge sum for them – to purchase a tanker-load of water from a businessman in a neighbouring village and arrange for it to be poured into their tanks.', 'Says Teja Ram, “There’s much that can be done through local-level initiatives for people like the Bagariyas who often get completely left out in the planning and implementation of development schemes. Often, small gestures, like the tanks in the Bagariya settlement, can have a large impact on people’s lives and health, although they don’t cost very much. As the ‘Back to Basics’ programme shows, with just a few rupees one can help bring about major changes in the lives of entire families.”', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
3,2013-6,"['Archives', 'TBI Changemakers: Kshitij Mehra – Showing The Path To Young Minds']","['It takes courage to be a shining beacon for others. Especially for young and influential minds. However, it is a responsibility few take on, so that there is some kind of guidance available for children to make those tough career choices at the crucial time in life. Meet Kshitij Mehra, one such shining beacon, spreading awareness in the hills of Himachal at present.', 'Sometimes every effort goes in vain and sometimes a little push is all that you need to change people’s lives. And when it comes to being a guide for children, the more you indulge with them, the healthier the relation gets. As is often said, children are like clay, the way you mould them, that is the shape they take. Hence it is important to note how the children are being taught in school and how well their mentors and pedagogues are guiding them. There was a time when there were very few career prospects that children were aware of. But nowadays, many new professions have come up which were earlier thought of as hobbies only.', 'Rural India is still unaware of these prospects. All they know is a typical list of 4-5 career options and that’s it. But there are people like Kshitij Mehra who want to leave no stone unturned in making children aware of better future prospects for them. And why not? These children are the future of India.', 'Kshitij is the founder of ‘Yuvshaala‘, an organization that solely works in spreading awareness about career prospects for children, guiding and counseling them for a better future. Seeing that villages are the ones most deprived of such knowledge, their prime focus became villages initially. So it was very important to reach such places and let children and parents know the different opportunities available to them, and how they could use their skills in a professional way. When he first started this venture, he just had one motto in his mind, “If I am able to change the life of at least one child, it would be the biggest achievement for me!”', 'Kshitij was travelling to Himachal to conduct a session for an organization he was working for at that time. It was here that he realized the fact that people in such areas are not aware of things that the city people are exposed to. He determined at that time that, sooner or later, he will reach these people with a motive of giving them an insight of how the world is full of unseen opportunities for them. Thus Yuvshaala was formed.', 'At the beginning of any venture, it is important to find a proper way for funds to come in. Kshitij and his team were against the idea of getting funds in charity. So they did things differently. Since Kshitij himself had some knowledge about finance and knew about the budget and capital, he and his team calculated that if they collect even Rs.10 from each student who attended the session, it was easy for them to proceed with their idea of guiding the children. The fee is never forced upon them, he said. It’s their free will to pay or not.', 'The first year was totally dedicated to Himachal Pradesh Government schools, in the second year they focused on private schools as well. The current scenario is such that they have established their roots amongst the colleges as well.', 'Kshitij and his team follow a four-step process called MARG:', '– Aptitude Training\n– Personality development\n– Behavior understanding and Development\n– Personality and Ethic Development', 'They first introduce the team to the class – tell them about who they are and what the organization does. It’s an interactive session, wherein the team and the children get to mingle with each other and open up their minds to each other. They believe it’s very important to know the mind of the child, what learning capabilities the child possesses, his/her linguistic skills, interpersonal skills, etc. After these things are known they conduct a psychometric test.', 'Once the result of the test is out, the children are divided into groups of the same genre. This is just to make them feel comfortable, but they are not forced to. It’s a 3-4 hour workshop, wherein interaction is the key and focus is on interpersonal communication.', 'In the coming 5 years, Kshitij sees Yuvshaala reaching the depths Punjab, Himachal and Haryana. They are presently working on the schools of Kullu, as he thinks that the children there are open to new ideas and new professions.', 'Becoming a support line for students is the vision of Yuvshaala, that too in such a manner that they are employable by the time they complete their education. Kshitij’s contribution in making India a better country is to focus on the education sector. He feels that putting in tons of money in education sector is not the solution for improving quality in education, but the implementation of plans and schemes is what should be focused upon. Better training of the teachers is a must.', 'Being young and so energetic, a sparkle can be seen in his eyes when he talks about children, education and spreading awareness among them. Yuvshaala was formed in 2010, and the kind of efforts he has put in the past 3 years is worth applauding. His success is a result of pure determination and a fire within him to do something for the children and the society. Yuvshaala has a bright future and a lot is yet to be seen from this young enthusiast.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
4,2013-6,"['Archives', 'TBI Water Week: Back To Life – The Story Of A Lake']","['In concluding our Water Week, we couldn’t think of a more apt story than one that fills our hearts with gladness, and an old, defunct lake with water! Read how the efforts of an Environmental outfit, together with the co-operation and willingness of the villagers, revived a lake thought to be dead, and turned around the fortunes of a small region.', 'World Water Day is celebrated every year. And every year we re-dedicate ourselves to improving the quality and quantity of water in the world. But then, are we doing enough?', 'The Government comes out with grand plans for lake development and river cleansing. Very few projects are implemented. Individuals and NGOs try to do something in a small way and plod around in bits and pieces. But, I recently came across a superb effort in lake restoration that makes me optimistic. I wish to share the details with you.', 'Ecoserve is a small environmental outfit in Bangalore focusing on Rain Water Harvesting and water development projects. It is run by a small band of enthusiasts led by G. Manjunath.', 'In one of their surveys of old and abandoned water bodies in South India, they came across an old lake bed in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, close to the river Krishna. Over the years, the lake had vanished and the bed had dried up and cracked. Ecoserve offered their services to the local people and soon found that they were very keen to bring the lake back to life.', 'A survey was conducted of the topography and the catchment areas. Field investigations found that the water feeder points were choked and obstructed. A discussion with the local people indicated that the lake did catch some water whenever it rained, but the percolation loss in the lake bed was high and soon the lake dried up.', 'Soil percolation tests were conducted at site and it was found that in fact the pit water retention was hardly for 10 minutes. The question was how to retard percolation and hold water. An answer had to be found which was technically sound and economically viable.', 'A technical data search by G. Manjunath revealed a methodology for lake bed flooring using natural earth and clayey soil. Elaborate methods of layering, leveling and compacting had to be adopted. It was decided to conduct tests by modelling quantities and procedures. Three trial pits were made first at site in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh and again in Jayanagar, Bangalore in 2006. Three different mixtures of earth and clay were layered, leveled and compacted on the floors. The pits, which were fairly large, were filled with water and the percolation times were logged.', 'Two of the pits showed reduced percolation, but not too significant. The third pit, however, showed remarkable results. The percolation rate reduced by over 95 %. The floor layering data was cross-checked and the tests were repeated twice. The results were consistent and the fall in percolation rate was phenomenal.', 'Estimates were prepared and proposals submitted to the Gram Panchayat and local people at site. The methods of funding the project were discussed and many options evaluated. It was decided to propagate the idea with local and nearby companies and industries as well as the Government and individuals. A sustained campaign was launched and soon results started appearing in the form of interest and pledges of assistance. The enthusiasm snowballed and the project took off.', 'For over a year the lake bed was dug up, carved and excavated. It was covered with lake bed earth, treated and mixed soil and later leveled and compacted. Bunds and retaining walls were built and landscaped.', 'The lake area is around 1500 square metres and can collect 25 lakh litres of water. The feeder canals from the rain catchment areas were cleaned and re-contoured. The link gullies from the distribution canal of the river Krishna to take up river overflow water were set up.', 'The first rain was absorbed by the soil on the lake bed and a small puddle was formed. Overflow water from the river Krishna flowed in and it formed a small pond.', 'The second rain gave dramatic results. The lake filled up and the very sight was thrilling. Today it has been two years since the work was done and the lake is brimming with water. It is in its majestic glory and full of life. The photograph was taken in February 2009 when water was scarce in the region.', 'Before the treatment to the floor of the lake, the percolation loss was heavy. Within 10 minutes all collected water was lost. Now, after four layers of treatment using natural earth and clay mixtures the percolation loss has reduced by 95 to 99 %. The evaporation loss is also negligible.', 'The local people have future plans for the lake. The water will be drawn to a filter house, cleaned, purified and pumped to nearby villages and towns as safe drinking water. The rains and the overflow of the river Krishna will replenish the water in the lake.', 'The old lake in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh is now no longer dry. It is flush with water.

5,2013-6,"['Archives', 'TBI Water Week: Water Committee Shows the Way to Equal Distribution and Optimum Utilization of Water']","['Continuing our water series this week, today we profile a few remarkable people and organizations who have turned around several villages in Gujarat, a largely arid part of the country, into fertile agricultural land. This article demonstrates nicely what can be achieved when government agencies, non-governmental organizations and local governance bodies like water committees can work together and inspire community-level participation and ownership.', 'Rains in Gujarat have brought smiles on the faces of farmers. Rainfalls in the last few years have been erratic. Since last ten years, efforts have been made to store rainwater. The water is beneficial for irrigation purpose. It is stored in check dams which are not sufficient for serving the irrigation purpose. Seeing this, a new scheme was launched in the nation. This project is known as Water shed. It is considered the most successful scheme till date. Significant improvements have been made for forest, agricultural land and water under this project. Voluntary organizations have made significant contribution towards water storage. Watershed means ‘a huge water body’. Water stored in the highest range between one or two village reaches the lower-most region, which is the main motive of scheme. In this process various structures like check dam, plugging of lanes, wire mesh etc are created which help in storing water at different levels.', 'Different organizations have worked on this project. Sadguru Water and Development Foundation, Aga Khan Rural Support programme, Development Support Center, Utthan, Kundla Taluka Gram Vikas Mandal and Manav Kalyan Trust are few of them. Premjibapa and Shyamji Antala, two old men from Saurashtra started the new wave of storing water through innovation. Premji started a water revolution under the name of ‘Vruksh Prem Seva Trust’ which brought about change in the villages of Jaamkarodana taluka. Rivers of these villages have become active through watershed and other water storage activities. He left Mumbai and settled at Upleta after retiring from his business. His name is taken with great pride in the field of water storage. Shyamji Antala is now a well-known personality at national and international forums. He has made farmers understand the importance of recharging and storing water. In all, he has recharged over one lakh wells in villages.', 'Once the rains have filled the canals and rivers, it’s time to talk about the role played by water committees. With the guidance and support of voluntary organizations, small groups have done wonders. Bamanmor, Rangpur, Thaloda and Kiyadar villages have successfully done the impossible. In order to make the Gujarat irrigation scheme a success, the government introduced a partnership model in 1995. On a pilot basis, Development Support Center was entrusted with the task of providing Dharoi irrigation scheme for Thalotha village under Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) model. Along with the state government, DSC successfully implemented the scheme. The farmers reaped the benefits of the scheme. The organization was entrusted to implement the scheme in other villages. Today 40 villages are actively involved in the scheme.', 'Rangpur is one of the villages which come under Visnagar taluka of Mehsana Jilla in Gujarat. The population of this village is 1426. Water committee was set up in 1983-84 but had become void, and was reincarnated by DSC in 1996. The water from Dharoi dam could suffice the irrigation need of villages but Rangpur village had to repair its canals. Survey was conducted jointly by officials from the irrigation department, DSC and committee representatives. On the basis of the survey, estimation was made for repairs of canals and a map was prepared. Generally, for major repairs, the entire cost is borne by the government and the beneficiaries shrug away from the responsibilities. However, in this case, the total repair cost was Rs 9,16,000 and 10% of this i.e. Rs. 91,600 was borne by the farmers’ committee. Under the supervision of the committee, a canal repair committee was set up. The repair committee was divided into various tasks like surveillance committee, finance committee, goods committee, etc. Once the canal was repaired, accounts were also maintained by the committee.', 'In 1998, for irrigating Rabi crops, 125 hectare of land was allotted under the irrigation scheme but the enthusiasm of farmers enabled irrigation in 166 hectare of land. Similarly in 1998-99 instead of the allotted 140 hectare, 158 hectares could be irrigated. The dearth of water at dams prevented farmers from availing irrigation facility for the next two years. In the current year, 178 hectares of land could be irrigated against the 125 hectares allotted. This indicates that proper planning and implementation helped in more land coverage under the scheme. Control in usage of water enabled more water allocation for irrigation. Water allocation in the village became timely and controlled. Better co-ordination was developed between farmers and the Irrigation department.', 'Every year the canals have to be cleaned and maintained. The government charges Rs.2 per meter for doing the same. The committee at Rangpur, with a view to saving money and taking ownership, decided to clean the 10km long canal by themselves. Cleaning the canal enabled 5 more hectare of land to get the benefit of water.', 'The scheme stood out as each drop of water was judiciously used. The value of water was understood by farmers of these regions. The water supply committee proved beneficial to the farmers in the following ways:', 'The Dharoi irrigation scheme proved to be beneficial to farmers of Rangpur and other villages. The villages of Mehsana and Patan helped to foresee various issues and their solutions of involving people participation. If the entire nation, which has 125 lakh hectare agricultural land, involves the farmer in its schemes and allows allocations to be made by farmers, the land will become much greener.', 'The water stored in Dosalidhuna dam is distributed through pipelines to villages. There are 48 members in the committee who work hand in hand to resolve the water issues. The total cost of distributing water comes to Rs.8,13,040 out of which seven lakhs can be obtained from state government’s Famine Relief Fund and Rs.83000 from Jilla Gram Vikas Agency. It is often seen that funds received for this purpose are utilized for other activities. But Bamanbori committee saved Rs.74,000 from the fund and created another reserve fund. The corpus fund is bound to remain as a reserve fund because the accounting and other expenses are borne from taxes.', 'The efficiency by the water committee has proved that people in village are often seen as illiterate and dull but are aware of their responsibilities. The government should allow water committees to look after the distribution of irrigation needs in the entire nation. This would give authority and wealth in the hands of poor.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
6,2013-6,"['Archives', 'TBI Water Heroes: Chandra Shekar – Presenting A Strong Case For Open Wells']","['The monsoons are here! As many parts of India are celebrating the relief from scorching summers, let us not forget that this year India faced one of its worst water crises, and what is even more disheartening, the predictions for availability of potable and usable water are bleaker for the coming years. This report co-authored by McKinsey & Company predicts that India needs to double its water-generating capacity by 2030 to meet the demands of its burgeoning population. Another independent study shows that groundwater in major Indian cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad is declining so rapidly that they might soon be bone dry! Even with the onset of rains, water scarcity is a problem that remains. So is there no hope?', 'Fortunately, there is. This week, we pay tribute to Water Heroes: People and Organizations who have been at the forefront of water conservation and reuse – by restoring and reviving water bodies, recharging groundwater or optimizing the use of water resources. We bring to you their ideas and methodologies so that we can all appreciate their work, support it and implement it in our own surroundings!', 'In the first article of the series, we present Mr. S Chandra Shekar, who lays down the case for open wells, and shares his own experience of creating one in his home at a locality called Jayanagar in Bangalore. He explains in detail the process of water supply and distribution, taking the case of Bangalore in particular, but it applies to every city in India and is a good guide to understand how these systems work (or not work!), and how we can move to a more sustainable living in terms of our water needs.', 'A Brief History:\nYears ago, there was no system of underground sump, overhead tank and piping for water supply. The only source of water to houses and institutions was the open well in the garden or backyard. First of all there were houses and cottages built on land – not apartment blocks. There was enough setback in all the directions and there was enough space for a garden and a well. The rains fed the open wells through percolation pits located near the wells and water filled up the pits, moved through the ground, got filtered and fed the wells’ cavities. There was always enough water , even in shallow wells, to supply a family’s needs comfortably. The water was not pumped out, but drawn out by using ropes and pulleys.', 'As late as the 1950s and even the 1960s in most towns, villages and cities, the open well was present and vital as a means of supplying water.', 'Then came the centrifugal pump and suction and delivery piping. The water was pumped from the well to the overhead tank and then distributed all over the house through pipes. Later on, piped water came from the centralised Water Board and BWSSB (Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board). This water was supplied to wards and layouts by means of underground pipes, and fed the underground sumps which stored the water. This water was pumped directly from the sump to the overhead tank and distributed all over the house.', 'This was when the open well was abandoned and forgotten. A big folly!', 'The Water Board and BWSSB get their water from the big dams near Mysore and pump it uphill to Bangalore, so that they can feed the sumps in the individual houses. Now, when the Krishnarajasagar and other dams are empty because of failure of the rains, there is no water to feed the sumps.', '\nThis photo of Krishnarajasagar Dam is courtesy of TripAdvisor', 'If only the people had not abandoned the open wells and started depending blindly on the piped water, there would have been a back up system in place if the rains failed. But the open wells have all or almost all gone and disappeared now.', 'Besides the open wells, in the olden days, we had a simple treatment plant in the garden to clean and purify the waste water from the kitchen, bathrooms, showers and handwash sinks. This water, called Grey water, was initially sedimented by adding alum and other coagulants and allowed to settle. The overflow was taken and run over a small slope of rocks and pebbles to allow aeration and oxygenation of the water. The collected water was again allowed to settle and the overflow was passed through a filter made out of intermediate layers of sand, pebbles and charcoal to clarify the water. The final collected water was again allowed to settle and the overflow stored in a tank. This water as used for gardening, cleaning vehicles, washing floors, etc, other than drinking and bathing. The toilet flush water was passed into a septic tank and soak pit. The septic tank was an anaerobic chamber where biological degradation of sewage took place and the collected sediment became good quality compost. The overflow water went to the soak pit which percolated to the ground, got filtered naturally in the soil and joined the underground aquifers.', 'This was the way sustainable housing was operated in the 1960s . Our total dependence on the Government bodies for both fresh water supply and sewage treatment has removed initiative from us and we have become dependent on systems which fail often.', 'A lot of rain falls on the roads and flat surfaces. When Jayanagar was first formed we had percolation pits at strategic places on the sides of the roads which collected rainwater and fed them or rather pushed them into the soil by means of gravity. Rather than have choked up storm water drains, several percolation pits will trap the rainwater where it falls and feed it into the ground for recharging the aquifers.', 'I have seen old buildings in Mysore where the rainwater from the roof is collected, passed on through pipes to the basement collection tank. In the basement there is a big waterproof tank to store rainwater. The overflow water from this basement tank feeds into a channel leading outside the house into the garden and feeds a pond or a small lake. During the rainy season, there is so much water, that the overflow water leads to overflowing of the pond. In some places where the house is in a village, the pond is located in a ground where cattle and sheep can drink water and villagers can bathe and wash clothes.', 'Modernisation with piped water and centralised water systems for supply has robbed us of our creative genius and innovation. I think we should go back to basics and fundamentals and apply simple solutions to overcome the present water crisis, instead of asking the Government to do something.', 'Water Shortages – An Open Well RWH solution:\nBangalore is well known for its open wells. So why don’t we revive and take care of our open wells? Places like Malleswaram, Basavanagudi, Jayanagar and VV puram have large wells in the gardens of houses.', 'I have a house in Jayanagar which is 50 years old, and has a well which is 35 feet deep and about 3 feet in diameter. Many years ago – around 15 years ago – I installed rooftop Rain water harvesting structures. I collect around 1 Lakh Litres (100,000 Litres) of rainwater each year. I filter the collected water from the roof and feed it to the well. In about two weeks of rainfall, the well is full of filtered water. The photos below show the well brimming with water. These photos were taken last season.', 'I have estimated that I consume around 40,000 litres of water each year from the well. The remaining 60,000 litres feed the ground water aquifers. This is a substantial amount of water both for home consumption as well as ground water recharging. During the rainy season I am happy to shut off the BWSSB supply valve. When I use well water for all our needs, I not only save on my BWSSB bills but also precious Cauvery river water which is now available for other users.', 'The rain water harvesting solution is simple and one can do it oneself. It is a self-help aid. The cost involved is only for the PVC pipes and filter. In my case I did the plumbing work myself, and it did not cost me much.', 'I wish other citizens of our country help themselves and become self-reliant as regards water needs.', 'Feel free to contact Chandra Shekar for any queries or assistance in setting up water structures in your own home or community.

7,2013-6,"['Archives', 'TBI Inspirations: Navin Gulia – Driving The Point Home']","['Delhi’s Navin Gulia hit headlines after his driving world record in 2004, but has since traveled to even more gratifying life motives, all from his wheelchair. Read about the remarkable man and his undying spirit that leads him to work towards the greater good, in spite of his disabilities.\xa0', '‘If you have not discovered a passion worth dying for, your life is not worth living,’ American icon Martin Luther King had once said, and so had Navin Gulia while atop the highest motorable pass in the world, Marsimik La at 18, 532 feet. ‘Life was always beautiful. From now, it gets better’, is what he felt after witnessing the breath-taking view.', 'Beginning in 1973, Gulia’s story has many ingredients novel writers dig. The prologue of this, he says, would be “Life has to come and go but we need to make something of it.” No, he wouldn’t have been philosophizing thus had his desire (and destiny) not taken him to the Indian Military Academy when he was 18. Always competing with his brother, Navin was a natural military scout. After four years of training, he reached a level called the ‘Passing Out Parade’ which required him to complete an obstacle course. “I was at the top of a high ramp after crossing an eight feet ditch when I felt a push.” In a moment that changed his life course, Navin landed on his upper back, damaging his spine as he tumbled from the pedestal.', 'For two whole years after this, he was unable to move, lying in a hospital bed. “If an enemy can attack you from three directions, he will attack you from the fourth. Life is the same,” he explains, like a military man, also showing the spirit to harbour no grudge against his batch-mate who ‘pushed’ him. “I’m sure he did not intend to paralyze me,” he tells us with a slight chuckle. And though his doctor claimed he would never be able to move again, Gulia had a vitally different view this.', 'In these two years, Navin kept his mind agile by solving puzzles. He was determined to sharpen his faculties since his body would no longer be able to do what it once did. After being discharged, he completed his Masters in Computers and the UGC NET examination, to become a teacher. The stint wasn’t a long one as he soon began to nurture a buzz to be mobile, not confined to a classroom.', 'I wanted to drive a car. I knew no one else would understand what I wanted. So I began to learn a bit about automobiles online.', 'It began with modifying the humble Maruti 800 into a fancier model.', 'Telling people to not give up was one thing; exhibiting the same through decisions and actions was another, and Gulia never had doubts to choose the latter. “I decided to drive up to Khardung La, which is thought to be the highest motorable pass. After completing that, I discovered that Marsimik La was the highest.” That was when he summoned the courage (and by some perspectives, insanity) to undertake an arduous drive and in 2004, Gulia hit headlines for driving non-stop for 55 hours, from Delhi to Marsimik La. “Frankly, my brother’s shadow and the unwavering will to compete with him empowered me to complete the drive. I never thought about failing,” he talks of the drive behind the drive. The feat bagged him a bunch of awards, including the Global Indian of the year and the National Role Model Award in 2006.', 'There are many people with disabilities who have nursed their will and done outstandi things (as we have featured earlier!), but perhaps Gulia lives a different life than them, one ridden with substantial media attention.', '“Who wouldn’t love it?” he reacts. “But it shouldn’t stop there. It should help me raise funds for my initiative.” Gulia is fruitfully diverting the glare on him to his initiative, ‘Apni Duniya Apna Ashiana’, an outfit to support marginalized children from weaker sections of society. “No child should be made to beg. The state of a nation is decided by the weakest and poorest,” he explains, adding how he’s in talks with the government to get orphans and street children off the streets and into the schools. Headlines hit, personal achievements unlocked, “Now my main aim is to be constructive for society,” Gulia says of his zone now.', 'For now, his routine is also about motivational speaking, where he’s addressed as an ‘author’ among other titles!', 'I took to compiling my experiences in a book to be able to express and reach out to many more people and tell them that amazing things are possible with just a little perseverance.', 'In ‘Quest of the Last Victory’, Gulia talks of the drive of his life, his philosophies before and after it and more. “The drive was a very humbling experience for me but a rewarding one too at the same time,” he sums up.', 'He doesn’t reveal too many of his future plans but we could safely assume they would fall under the ‘good of society’ category. But while chatting about learning new things, he throws us back a bit by saying, “Currently I’m learning a bit of mimicry and classical music.” And to think his book already being an inspiration, the story of the man behind it isn’t finished yet', 'Gulia isn’t the first man on a wheelchair we are chatting with as part of this series, but one of his attitudes sums up those of all the heroes we have featured here, as it is his belief that', 'Each time a difficult task crosses our paths, remember, it’s our thoughts that stop us, not our abilities.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
