This is Adalaj Ni Vav at the outskirts of Ahmedabad, Gujarat.', 'It’s a well, but there is no drinking water available. Exchanging pleasantries with damp smells and a few bats wasn’t exactly the introduction I was looking for. But having overlooked these nags, what you do get to see is an example of function blended so well with the form, that it puts commercial architects to shame. A Vav in Gujarati, means a stepwell – a well that is accessed through many steps.', 'Built as a resting place for pilgrims and traders by the then Queen, Rudabai, this Vav served more than a utilitarian purpose. Alternatively, you could call it the Facebook of the 15th century. People who came in to fill water or to quench their thirst and rest, would eventually interact and mingle and even trade. So you 21st centurions have no reason to swell about the advent of social networking – the wise Yodas of yesteryears have been there, done that!', 'The Adalaj Ni Vav stands as the only major monument of its kind, with three entrance stairs leading to a stepped corridor. These three entrances meet at the first storey, underground, in a huge square platform. There are openings in the many ceilings which make way for good ventilation for the octagonal well. However, direct sunlight does not touch the flight of steps or landings except for a brief period at noon. The structure’s interplay with light is worth a see. Best time to go would be when the sun’s up and when you, are underground.', 'It is also a spectacular example of Indo-Islamic architecture and design. The cross pollination of creativity brings its rewards in more than the intended area. As a hub that encouraged interaction, business, culture, the Vav stands as an edifice of innovation and craftsmanship that one can only marvel at.', 'Talking further won’t help unless you see this objet d’art. Also, a very small but interesting mirror temple adorns the site. Again, not worth a miss!', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
1,2011-4,"['Written by Unnati Narang', 'Street Magicians of India: Bringing you closer to reality']","['As children, all of us enjoyed watching the magician pull out a rabbit from a hat. Over the years, it has become one of the most familiar magic tricks. Yet the world of magic is deeper and darker. For those of us who carefully watched Christopher Nolan’s Prestige, we know magic knows no bounds and can drive one to dangerous means to get the act right.', 'Watching a magician perform may look glamourous on stage, but there is much more to it. The best people to know this are those who are in the trade, making a living out of surprising people every time with their tricks. In India, traditional magicians are taking the trade forward, and along with it, the Indian heritage.', 'Ever heard of the Indian mango mystery? Or the Indian basket trick (Indrajal)? These masterpiece illusions and several others such as the flying Indian man have several hundred years of history behind them. In the modern era, two traditional magicians performing them are Aas Mohammed Khan and Babban Khan. A few years ago, they were confined to the slums of Delhi and their rare art could not reach beyond these small sections. Until Peter Theobald, at that time a sales executive in Mumbai and also an amateur magician, saw their conditions and decided to take them places. He met them for the first time in May 2008 at the Magic Convention in Kerala. While he was astounded by their skills, at the same time he was shocked by their poverty and the way they were being treated. That is when he started Street Magic India.', '“I am not a street magician. I perform mostly for kids and also some mind-reading for adults. Am not a street magician.  I work with a group of traditional Indian magicians (wrongly referred to as street magicians, because unfortunately they have been reduced to working on the streets). My motivation to perform magic was to bring a smile on the faces of poor, disadvantaged or sick children for whom I usually perform.”\n\nThe magical trio of Aas Mohd, Babban Khan and Nadir Khan  \nToday these street magicians perform various shows. With Theobald’s help, their skills can now shine and get noticed by thousands of people. Additionally, they are also getting paid for their work. Theobald discusses an incident, “After our Mumbai show, later in the evening, I handed over Rs. 11,000 to Aas Mohammed, the balance money that I had planned to give him for his efforts. “Are you happy?” I asked him. “I would have been happy even if you had not given this money,” he had replied.”\n\nBabban ready for a rope escape', 'How is street magic making India a better India in terms of its social impact? Theobald says, “It just makes adults children again. It helps the audience forget the worries of the world for a short while, to emerge refreshed and better equipped to tackle it. Children too enjoy the mystery and the fun associated with magic tricks.”', 'For traditional magicians of India, it is a ‘khandani pesha’ and they have been doing it for generations. What is unique about them is that they make their own tricks, are self taught and never teach others their tricks. Regular magicians go to a magic shop, buy tricks, go to a magic teacher, buy videos and books and learn the same tricks that everyone performs. “The tricks the traditional guys perform – no one quite knows how they are done,” says Theobald with a conviction that makes magic all the more real, even for nonbelievers.', ""Co-Founder of Serene Woods portal for authors and photographers, I have authored two books - 'Drenched Soul' (poetry) and 'If At All' (fiction).

2,2011-4,"['Archives', 'Women Entrepreneurs Go Organic!']","['\n\n\nby\n\nSharmistha Dey\n\n\nApril 12, 2011, 8:30 am \n\n\n', 'Organic food is eco-nutritionist Kavita Mukhi’s passion. First as the founder of Conscious Food and now as the person behind Mumbai’s first weekly organic farmer’s market, she has consciously spread the word on nutritionally healthy foods.', 'Of course, now with the ‘Go Organic!’ mantra finding favour with many eco-conscious city women – simply because the advantages of choosing natural over adulterated are far too many – it’s little wonder that the number of organic product companies and consumer stores across Indian metros is only growing. Behind these ventures are successful women entrepreneurs for whom ‘healthy’, ‘farm-fresh’ and ‘chemical-free’ are the magic words.', '“Consuming planet-friendly food is not just about feeding our body. It is about taking care of our earth. Our bodies move on but our earth is here to stay and nourish the generations to come. Every choice we make towards the way we decide to live makes a difference to the air we breathe, water we drink and soil we depend on,” writes Mukhi in her blog.', 'Though she moved on from Conscious Food years back, she put her energies into setting up the farmer’s market. “I started this market to help our farmers get their due. The response has been good if not overwhelming. But as I see it, we have a long way to go. People who come to visit this market are those who truly believe in organic,” she says.', 'Organic fruit and vegetables apart this market, located in Mumbai’s western suburb of Bandra, also has goodies like organic sugar candy floss, organic tea and coffee, auro natural wall paints and macrobiotic food.', '“It is not easy for farmers in India to get organic certification for their produce especially when standards for hygiene maintenance and transportation are high and when there is copious paperwork involved. There are many certification agencies that label organic produce; in our case, we have tied up with EcoCert, an international agency that certifies organic products,” she adds.', 'But is organic really the “real thing”? “Yes,” says Mukhi, “Organic foods are those that are grown without chemical fertilisers and pesticides, on land that has not been contaminated for at least three years. I have been using the term planet-friendly to indicate produce grown with natural manure and natural pesticides only.”', 'Nutritionist Ishi Khosla is only too happy to spell out the benefits of organic eating. The founder and director of Whole Foods says, “Growing food organically doesn’t alter the nutritional content but avoids the synthetic pesticidal and insecticidal residues. Besides the fact that these foods contain fewer chemical residues, they also retain phenolic compounds – chemicals that act as a plant’s natural defense – that also happen to be good for our health. These plant compounds are lost or significantly reduced in conventional farming.”', 'According to the World Health Organization (WHO), by 2015, India is likely to incur a loss of $236.6 billion due to unhealthy lifestyle and faulty diet. Khosla points out, “As Indians are genetically predisposed to chronic diseases such as diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD) it is necessary to be conscious of the food choices we make. With many more people now indulging in dietary indiscretions – given the plethora of processed foods at our disposal – and eventually inviting serious health disorders, going organic is a sensible way of bringing about the much needed healthy changes in not just food but our overall lifestyle.”', 'Though Khosla continues to spread the word on organic foods through Whole Foods, she believes that a sea change in the attitude towards health can only take place with government intervention: With the help of necessary policy changes that will promote the consumption of healthy food.', 'But as the director of Navdanya, a three-and-a-half-year-old store in Andheri, Mumbai, Reetha Balsavar has seen the change in consumer patterns and vouches for the growing popularity of all things organic. She says, “People are picking up the organic mantra slowly and steadily. Primarily, it is the womenfolk leading the way. Our clientele has grown steadily over the years. We have broadly four different categories of clients – young mothers, who want to start their children on an organic diet and slowly convert the entire household; the second are people who have had a taste of the organic lifestyle while living abroad and want to continue with the same trend back home; the third category consists of people who have been, or have had a family member affected by serious ailments such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease, and the fourth are those who are already eco conscious and believe in living a planet-friendly life. I believe there is always a trigger for people to start off. The campaigns against the BT Brinjal last year have made that tangible difference in making people aware and understand the importance of natural (read organic).” Navdanya retails a variety of agricultural produce, including dals (pulses), attas (flours), spices, rice, squashes, dry fruit, herbal teas, and so on.', 'Despite the knowledge and obvious benefits of chemical-free food items, perhaps the one reason that is keeping many people away from these outlets are the higher prices of these products. Says Urvashi Mody, partner of Eco Corner Mumbai, a store that encourages living a healthy and eco-friendly lifestyle, “Although organic products are available for a premium, the current environmental climate consciousness is leading more and more people to go organic when they can afford it. It is our mission to place our product range within the reach of every eco-conscious citizen of India. The good news is that there is large scale awareness already; our regular clientele apart, first-time visitors do not walk away without the knowledge of why it is necessary to adopt an organic lifestyle.” Home accessories, aroma products, natural bath and body products, jute handbags and exclusive handmade stationary products are available at Eco Corner.', 'Khosla adds to this hopeful attitude, “The market for organic products is growing rapidly and although some of these, particularly organic foods, cost 10 to 15 per cent more than that of conventional food items – which are anyway not cheap, given the current economic climate in the country – with higher demand and consumption of organic products, the prices are likely to come down eventually.”', 'In fact, Navdanya’s organic foods prices are more or less in line with regular market rates: A 500 gram packet of Toor dal comes at Rs 65 or Masoor dal at Rs 60; flours like besan (gram flour) and ragi (finger millet) are sold for Rs 47 and Rs 42, respectively, for 500 grams.', 'The price difference was also visible at Mukhi’s farmer’s market recently. According to media reports, a few weeks back when the onion prices shot up, retailing in the regular markets from anywhere between Rs 60 to Rs 70 per kilo, at the organic market, they sold for Rs 40. The vegetables at the farmer’s market are supplied by a co-operative of over 2,000 farmers in the Nashik region near Mumbai, whose practices are attested by Ecocert. The farmers harvest and transport the produce to the city at their own expense while the market provides them with the space to sell. Prices are set depending on the farming labour, costs and a fair return.', 'But while this market may not be exactly a fair comparison price-wise – since there are costs involved for regular retailers which are not included into the price of the vegetables here (they have the support of the market organisers) – what it does demonstrate, is that organic foods can soon actually become a viable alternative.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

4,2011-4,"['Archives', 'An illiterate Farmer designs a Water Mill to generate Electricity']","['\nSiddappa, an illiterate farmer from Somapur village in Gadag district of Karnataka, has designed a water mill to generate electricity. Right from conceptualizing to materialisation, the farmer has done everything on his own. He operates the water mill in the canal near his house.', 'Using timbers, Siddappa prepared a giant wheel that joined at a central hub. There are eight arms, five feet each, extending from the central hub. A plastic bucket is dangled at the tip of each arm. When the water from two pipes gushes into one of the buckets, it generates the pressure that turns the 10-feet wheel in an anti-clockwise motion. The bucket could also be spun in the horizontal plane using a central steering wheel, similar to a teacup ride. As one after another bucket is driven by the flowing water, the first arm declines back to the ground while the other rises in the air. This process spins the black wheel attached to this giant wheel. The spinning black wheel rotates another wheel connected to a dynamo.', 'A converter converts the Direct Current from the dynamo into Alternating Current. Siddappa claims to have spent a mere Rs 5000 on building the entire apparatus. This is his second attempt to show the villagers that anybody can produce electricity for self-consumption using the resources at hand. “Many people who have canals flowing near their villages don’t know how to use that natural gift. I want to show them all practically that electricity problems can be solved by being creative. There is no need to beg to the government for everything,” he says.', 'He gets 150 watts of power from this water mill when water flows in the canal. Siddappa claims he can create electricity for the entire village through his machine. But the problem is that the canal in his village flows only for three months a year!', 'Readers: If you know of any such ideas/people that you believe we should feature here, please mail to contact [at] thebetterindia.com.\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

The survey showed that 81% of rural women use unsterilized cloth since it is relatively cheaper than sanitary napkins.', '\nMuruganatham (47) has developed an assembly of low cost, portable machines that produce quality sanitary napkins at a cost of Rs. 1 to Rs. 1.50 per pad approximately.', 'Tenth standard passed and with no further formal education, Muruganatham always had an attitude of a scientist – observing, experimenting and giving birth to new ideas. When he became aware that most rural women couldn’t afford sanitary napkin thus putting them in grave danger of various infectious diseases, he decided to do something about it.', 'Initially he worked with cloth but that didn’t give the desired results. He got a commercially available napkin and found out that they used wood fiber for draining the fluids and retaining shape of the pad. He sourced the requisite raw material and developed the final assembly of machines in 2004. He got encouraging feedback on it’s efficancy and subsequently improved the machine by adding UV sterilization unit, calibration and increasing the production rate to 1000 pads per day.', 'This machine heralds a new revolution in low cost personal hygiene\xa0 for women across all sections of society.
