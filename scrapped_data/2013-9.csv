At a time when chemicals have virtually replaced nutrients in food, women in this tiny area of West Bengal are growing food in a natural way – a method that is not just organic but uses ways to combine nature’s cycles and elements, creating a complementary ensemble. This is a way in which plants, animals, insects and all the elements of nature come together in harmony and leave little waste. Read further to know how they achieve this.', 'Till a few decades ago, most people in India grew vegetables and fruits in their own gardens. Then something changed. We shifted from ‘farming for food’ to ‘farming for money’. The start of the ‘green revolution’ meant that production increased but so did the farmer’s dependency on chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides. This shift in farming – from lifestyle to livelihood – also resulted in women keeping away from most farming decisions even though they were involved in the various tasks of sowing, reaping, harvesting and filling up the granaries. They aren’t called ‘farmers’ and they don’t benefit from training on farming concepts and schemes. But some women in villages in Alipurduar, West Bengal have managed to change this for themselves.', 'Bimala Barman from Paschim Borochowki village is an enthusiastic member of the Annapurna women’s self-help group. She looks after the group’s rice bank that is set up in her house. This 14-member group is futuristic to say the least. They collect surplus rice from each of their members’ rice produce and save it in their rice bank. They give this to people in the village, including their members, during the lean season when people don’t have enough to eat. The same is returned after the harvest. The Annapurna self-help group grows a range of vegetables together using self-prepared vermi-compost. Well aware of its benefits, the members show strong aversion towards chemicals. They are confident that their faith in the natural ways of keeping the soil healthy and fertile will pay off.', 'Bimala’s neighbour Kalpana Sutradhar has a farm, which mirrors a natural/forest ecosystem – where there is enough food for both man and animals. She grows multiple crops that complement each other so she has food year-round. On a small plot of land, she has placed several pots of water buried under the ground, which supply constant regulated moisture to the soil. The rest of the farm is irrigated with rainwater, which she catches in a pond that is also home to many kinds of fish. She also prepares compost using special earthworms (vermi), called vermicompost. All this and more has contributed to her confidence – she has managed to feed her family wholesome healthy food without having to depend much on the market.', 'This confidence is backed by sound knowledge too. With whatever little resources they have, these women are making sure that their efforts are sustainable. They grow fruits and vegetables following the principles of ecological or sustainable agriculture. At the heart of ecological agriculture is the economic, cultural and environmental well-being of all involved. It looks at the relationship of living beings with each other and with their habitat – ‘Vastu Tantra’ or ecology – and creates a system where they can mutually benefit. For example, paddy needs water, nutrition (fertilizer), weed control and manure. If you have 1-2 ducks in your paddy field, they would eat the weeds in the water and prevent them from forming again due to their constant paddling. Their excrete can be the food for the paddy. That reduces your labour and increases yield and the best part is that all this is achieved without using chemicals!', 'You can also grow your own healthy food by following the principles below.', 'Plant waste can feed birds or animals while their excreta can be used to make biogas. Further, the slurry, a by-product of bio-gas, can feed the earthworms or animals. Recycling helps in increasing energy efficiency in your production system.', 'Also, you can create a place for birds in your farm. A lot of birds feed on insects and not on fruits. Having a bamboo stick standing in the rice field where the birds could sit can help matters and you would not need to use chemicals to drive away the pests.', 'You can have your duck farm over your pond. The duck excrete will fall on the pond and become food for the fishe or the cow dung can be used to produce biogas for your kitchen. The slurry that it produces can become food for your fish, worms for vermin-compost, mushrooms or ducks. Nothing goes to waste at all!', 'Keep your soil healthy. You can do that without chemicals by using natural, renewable methods instead. Those are healthy and also free!', 'Trees such as pigeon pea or bamboo enrich the soil by their high nutrient content and serve as fodder for livestock. These may also be used as firewood. Local plants are naturally suited for the existing conditions of an area and grow without much external support. Using local varieties of plants also is easy on the pocket.', 'Use volunteer plants, which are plants that grown on their own and those which are un/under-utilized. For example water hyacinth can be used to grow oyster mushrooms or to grow a short-duration vegetable on a pile made of water hyacinth and soil. The attached manual ‘Integrated farming system – concept and farm design’ contains more information about the concept of ecological agriculture, its features, principles and farm designs.', 'Using such methods reduces our dependency over time and helps with social and economic welfare. Ardhendu Chatterjee, Executive Director of Development Research Communication and Services Centre in West Bengal, an organisation that focuses on ecological agriculture, is a dedicated ecological scientist. He says, “The more chemical farming is used, the more dependent we become. That’s why it is not just an environmental issue but a development issue”.', 'I came across a quote – “Growing your own food is like printing your own money”. By practicing self-sufficient farming, the women in these villages have done just that', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
1,2013-9,"['Archives', 'Unnayan Learning Hub: Educating Girls, Educating Communities']","['\n\n\nby\n\nDevanik Saha\n\n\nSeptember 25, 2013, 12:39 pm \n\n\n', 'A Teach for India fellow, Devanik Saha, found it difficult to leave the children he was teaching as part of the program, and also to stop teaching, once it came to an end. He also had a strong urge to do something more for the community he had come to love, especially the girls, who faced the most neglect and discrimination. Thus began Unnayan, a learning hub for these kids to come to after school and supplement their education and understanding, a dire need considering the state of most government-run schools in our nation. Here, Devanik recounts his journey so far.', 'Teaching Class 4E in MCD Pratibha Nigam Vidalaya in Sangam Vihar, an unauthorized colony in New Delhi, I witnessed the innumerable hurdles that exist for students enrolled in government-run schools looking for a meaningful education. In government schools in Sangam Vihar, there is an acute dearth of teachers with around 15 teacher vacancies in the school I taught and, unfortunately, even those few students who have the privilege of having a teacher present are not taught properly. Additionally, the prevalent gender discrimination results in neglect of girls’ education.', 'As a result, many promising girls are denied opportunities to receive wholesome education, severely denting their chances to improve their lives. Since my Teach For India fellowship period was coming to an end, I did not want to leave my students and certainly could not think of not teaching anymore. There was an urge to continue somehow. With this in mind, I approached one of my friends Swati, who used to volunteer in my class during her vacations and discussed the idea of starting a learning center in Sangam Vihar to make an impact. Thus, Swati and I decided to take the plunge and co-founded Unnayan instead of taking up offers of Masters in Development Studies with Sussex University and Masters in Social Policy at LSE respectively.', 'But the step wasn’t as easy as we had envisioned it to be. Every project needs funds to start-off and run, and same was the case with us. We struggled to raise funds for running the pilot which was supposed to be 2 months long. I called every possible number on my cellphone, emailed every possible id and met every possible person I could to explain about my project and get the seed fund. Finally after 2 months of intense efforts, we managed to raise around INR 60,000 for getting the project off the ground.', 'Through Unnayan, we support promising girls in low-income communities to extract the maximum benefit from their school education and become an educational community hub for girls in the community by supporting them in their education through after-school learning centers. It is an after-school-learning-hub focused towards educating girls to aid their school education. Currently, two programs are running at the center: 1) Early Childhood Program (Nursery- Class 2, Rs 180/month), 2) Elementary Education Program (Class 3-8, Rs 250/Month) with 27 and 66 kids enrolled in each respectively. The monthly fee collected from the students is used to sustain the center for various expenses such as resources, rent, maintenance and logistics.', 'The learning hub supports these girls with a platform which can help them to get the most out of their school education and acts as a supplement. With a strong focus on using activity and game based learning for primary-level girls (majorly government school girls due to lack of quality education), belonging to both English and vernacular medium, we try to support their academic growth. The venture’s long term vision is to scale to more centers and recruit teachers from the community itself and train them through various support structures to teach at the centers, once it gets more funding through donors and organizations. Going forward, Unnayan plans to employ a hybrid model of having a for-profit arm which would be enough to sustain each center individually as well as a non-profit arm which would raise grants and funds to scale and hire staff for coordinating the activities.', 'The whole experience of starting up a learning center in a low income community challenges you every day. We have to manage things like wading through knee-deep dirty water on rainy days, explaining to impatient parents about the learning process of their children and cleaning up the center by ourselves.', 'Apart from teaching, our team has been quite active in engaging the community, organizing a girls’ education campaign and a first of its kind self-defence camp for the women and girls of the community which received tremendous response. Starting with just 5 students, we now cater to around 90+ students. Unnayan has been featured in several mainstream publications and has been recognized as an educational innovation by Centre for Educational Innovation, an initiative of Results for Development Institute.

2,2013-9,"['Archives', 'TBI Uttarakhand Diaries: Mountaineers Are Coming Together To Rebuild The Local Community']","['\n\n\nby\n\nAnusha Subramanian\n\n\nSeptember 23, 2013, 4:52 pm \n\n\n', 'It has been three months since disaster struck Uttarakhand in June 2013, and the situation is still alarming. However, in Uttarakashi district where there has been widespread property destruction and loss of livelihood, the situation is worse, with not enough food supplies and no doctors to examine the sick. For a population of almost 3.5 lakh people in Uttarkashi, there is not one single woman doctor. The Mountaineering community is still reaching relief supplies such as medicines and food to the far-flung villages on foot as road connectivity is lost. Given this scenario, we here present two initiatives working towards rebuilding the lives of the locals.', 'The adventure community across Uttarakhand has been on their feet since the day the tragedy struck the state of Uttarakhand. When the government was busy concentrating on rescuing the pilgrims and tourists safely out of the state, the adventure community reached out to the neglected local communities across the affected districts. Rafters from Rishikesh were helping villagers from Chandrapuri and other villages with food and medicine supplies. It is during this time that Aditya Shinde, a professional mountaineer sitting far away in Pune decided he wanted to do something for the people of Uttarakhand.', 'Uttarakhand has always been second home for me, and while I am from Pune, I spent more time in the mountains. Therefore, it was only natural for me, when something of this magnitude happened in the mountains; it was time to give back to the people the joy and happiness the mountains have given me. And, so I initiated a plan to work on distributing relief and medical aid. There has been no looking back since then.', 'To begin with Shinde started a FB page called ‘For Uttarkhand’ and called out to fellow mountaineers who would be interested in volunteering relief operations in Uttarkashi district.', 'After having spread the word through social media, Shinde got in touch with Anjali Babbar Basu who runs SAHIL (Social Association of Humane Individuals for the Living). SAHIL has been doing projects in the education space and also has done rehabilitation projects during the Gujarat earthquake and other natural disasters in the country. After having discussed the plan with Basu, Shinde decided to be on ground and execute the project. That’s how began the initiative SAHIL ‘For Uttarakhand’.', '“We are engaged in providing relief and medical aid to the villages constituted under divisional block ‘Bhatwari’ in district Uttarkashi,” says Shinde.', 'The road (100kms) from Uttarkashi to Gangotri, which connects all the villages under Bhatwari, is destroyed. For the last two months, the villagers here are cut-off from regular access to supplies and medical aid. For a villager, to buy even a kg of sugar or salt, they have to trek anywhere between 40-50 kms. Not every villager can do that. Informs Shinde:', 'This is where we come in. Our group that consists of a supply team, camp managers and administrative team, works cohesively on ensuring a continuous supply/distribution of ration and medical aid to the people of affected areas.', 'Currently, SAHIL ‘For Uttrakhand’ is the only organization that is providing relief and medical aid ahead of Uttarkashi to areas that are cut-off and inaccessible via road. The volunteers trek over a distance of 32 kms with loads of 20-40 kgs to deliver supplies at their advance base camp in Bhatwari. They have been able to do this successfully so far as they have also got support from Goonj, a Delhi-based NGO which has been forthcoming in reaching them with supplies from Rishikesh, as well as the district authorities who have supplied them with stock locally available in Uttarkashi.', 'The core team of SAHIL ‘For Uttarakahnd’ consists of group of mountaineers including two Everesters – Krushna Patil and Arjun Vajpayi, although not for too long. Most volunteers stay for about 4 days to a week depending on their timelines. What has helped Shinde in undertaking such a task has been his experience of organizing and planning expeditions. He says:', 'Our experience in the mountains and especially from expeditions has helped us create a plan to distribute supplies in remote areas that are now cut off and inaccessible by road and other aid organizations.', 'Further, local porters who carry load up to 50kgs and trek across the mountains to reach these villages accompany the volunteers. In a day, on sheer manpower, the team ferries load up to 800 kgs from Uttarkashi to Bhatwari. “We ensure no wastage occurs in the stores, as the turnaround time for distribution of supplies is quick,” explains Shinde. In a way, SAHIL ‘For Uttarakhand’ has provided livelihood to the porters, their families and other locals engaged in the store.', 'Battling bad weather conditions, continuous landslides and lack of roads, SAHIL ‘For Uttarakhand’ has managed to reach out to 1500 people across 14 villages in the district. Apart from these, they have also reached out to approximately 300 outsiders namely people who do not have ration cards – migrant labourers and the BRO and GREF workers. The organization has also conducted 3 medical camps so far with 3 doctors namely Dr. Aditya Banerjee, Dr Shankar Murthy and Dr. Bhavin Kodiyatar volunteering and treating 757 patients across 8 villages.', 'For the moment, our relief and medical aid work will continue till such time that the roads and connectivity for the villages between Uttarkashi and Gangotri is not re-established.', 'says Shinde. There is still a requirement for doctors.', 'Going forward, SAHIL ‘For Uttrakhand’ intends to take up rehabilitation project in Uttarkashi district. Explains Shinde:', 'Rehabilitation is a broad spectrum work phase, and can include anything from rehabilitating an entire village into a new area, building homes or schools, or boosting the economy of the affected areas.', 'They are currently evaluating the situation for the same. SAHIL ‘For Uttrakhand’ has been raising funds from family, friend and corporate sponsors to keep continuing the work they have started.', 'Subramanian’s Summiting4Hope is an initiative wherein she and a few other mountaineers and adventurists are looking to raise funds for various identified causes through climbing and other adventure activities. The first project under Summiting4Hope is climbing and raising funds for rehabilitation and rebuilding of Uttarakhand. Says Subramanian:', 'We wanted to take the cause of the adventure community first and all those directly and indirectly associated with the business. Adventure companies here have lost all business for the year. As a result local porters, cooks and guides who help these companies in various trekking trips and expeditions have lost business. Therefore, I thought best would be to start with doing something for this community.', 'Adds Puri: “The conditions in the villages and on the roads after the disaster were so horrendous that even we who are mountaineers and trained in such conditions found them challenging. Thus, even though the task ahead is daunting we are determined to push through. Especially for me, as I am also from Uttarakhand and these are my own people, I feel that if we don’t rise to help ourselves then finding a long lasting solution will not be possible.”', 'The first Climbing Expedition in this endeavor is intended “In Uttarakhand, for Uttarakhand and by Uttarakhand”. The climbing expedition is being organized by 3Point Adventure, a local Uttarkashi based adventure sport company owned by Yashwant Panwar and Jay Panwar.', 'The 12 member team of climbers from across India including a few local Uttarakhandi climbers will climb Rudugaira Peak (5819 mts) part of the Gangotri range of mountains in the Garhwal hills. The climb is scheduled from October 1 to October 14, 2013.', 'Recent Government statistics estimate that 464 villages have been affected across 4 blocks in Uttarkashi district alone. These include 14,353 affected families that amount to a population of close to 60,000. “Having seen the destruction in Uttarkashi and its upper reaches up close and personal, we intend to continue our work in this region for a longer duration,” says Subramanian.', 'Summiting4Hope also has support from Dehradun-based Leap Foundation, which is working on rehabilitation projects in Uttarakhand. To make this noble endeavor a success, Summiting4Hope has raised funds from family, friends and even few corporate associates and small businesses. Going forward, Summitting4Hope will take up other fund raising activities such as a photography exhibition be able to continue the work in the long term.', 'Photo Credits: SAHIL ‘For Uttarakhand’ – Aditya Shinde; Summiting4Hope – Yashwant Panwar and Anusha Subramanian', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
3,2013-9,"['Archives', 'TBI Women: After 30 Years, Jharkhand Gets A Taste Of Woman Power']","['\n\n\nby\n\nSaadia Azim\n\n\nSeptember 19, 2013, 11:16 am \n\n\n', 'Women-led panchayats (village councils) in many parts of Jharkhand are proving to be a very successful model of governance, with the women leaders taking charge to address local and long-ignored issues like sustainable employment and equal pay for women, corruption in government schemes, women’s property rights, irrigation and water supply, among others. Could this be an example for the rest of the country?', 'Despite a promising career in the law, Dorothiya Dayamani Ekka opted to work for the development of her village. She had completed her bachelor’s degree in law from Ranchi University, Jharkhand, and had been inducted into the Ranchi Bar Association. She had even applied for a seat to pursue a Master’s degree in law when she decided to give it all up and tread a different path. Having contested the panchayat elections from Ara village in the Namkum block of Ranchi district in 2011, Dorothiya is now the ‘mukhiya’ (village head) of Ara and is focused on providing sustainable employment for the women of the village. As she explains:', 'Women do not find jobs easily because men are still preferred when it comes to employment. But they have tremendous potential, and if their natural skills are honed, they will excel in activities like kitchen gardening, poultry rearing and cattle breeding. We are working to develop small operational business models that will prove profitable for this village.', 'Today, the political scenario at Ara is in favour of women. Women head its nine wards and the village panchayat samiti has just one male representative. “With women in positions of power, it has been easier for other women here to build up their home businesses. It is not just making them self sufficient but also working for the overall progress of the village,” says Ellen Ekka, a health worker in the area.', 'Like Dorothiya, Shalini Gupta, who heads the Domchach block in Koderma district, is another inspiring grassroots leader. She is a vocal anti-corruption campaigner and along with her team of village women representatives, keeps a sharp eye on the working of the anganwadis (government-run mother-and-child-care centres in villages) in the area and tracks government schemes and funds that come to the panchayats.', 'This English graduate, who also has a diploma in software, has been able to bring to light the underhand practices of a corrupt Child Development Protection Officer, whose demands for money from anganwadi workers led to his arrest by the Enforcement Department a few of months ago. Shalini and her vigilant colleagues want to make Domchach corruption-free. Remarking on their commendable work, Dr Vishnu Rajgadia of the Jharkand Panchayat Women Resource Centre, which works to develop the capacities of women panchayat leaders in the state, notes:', 'This is a great effort from the women, not just because they have become the guardians of good practices but because they have been able to check corruption in the area to a large extent through a self monitoring process.', 'In 2011, Jharkhand had witnessed panchayat elections for the first time in three long decades. The Jharkhand Panchayat Act, 2005 has a provision for 50 per cent women’s reservation. But history was created when women contested and won in 56 per cent seats – the highest in the country. Observes Rajgadia, “Interestingly, women also contested from unreserved seats as well and won handsomely. This has helped build up their confidence and they can now think of wresting their due position in local politics.” If the outstanding work of leaders like Dorothiya and Shalini is any indication, then women leaders are bound to outnumber their male counterparts in the years ahead.', 'Of course, it is not just a matter of getting elected. Today these grassroot women leaders have come together to form a core committee to demand a greater role in policy-making. Their aim is to overcome the various bureaucratic hurdles in the implementation of developmental schemes. Recently, over 31,000 women leaders together participated in a rally at Ranchi’s Morabadi grounds, after which they handed over a charter of demands to the Jharkhand governor. The rally had been organised by the Panchayat Mahila Shakti Abhiyan, a platform that gives them an opportunity to brainstorm on their ground realities and work towards resolving problems together, with support from the central government’s Panchayat Mahila Evang Yuva Shakti Abhiyan.', 'Their charter of demands lists, among other issues, equal wages for women workers in every field; women help-desks to provide police, legal and social support at block offices; property and land rights for women; and 50 per cent seat reservations for women in the legislative assembly.', 'Dorothiya explains why panchayat need to be more empowered:', 'Today, because panchayats do not have the authority to disburse funds or take decisions, most of our schemes get stuck in bureaucratic hassles at the district level. We have to adjust to the policies of a given government, which in most cases are very driven by politics.', 'Adds Dr Rajgadia, who is presently working with UNICEF and the Panchayati Raj Department of the state government on behalf of the Panchayat Mahila Shakti Abhiyan, “With more power at the local level, grassroots issues gain importance and elected representatives can devote their work for the development of the area.”', 'In Shalini’s Domchach block, women representatives are concentrating on effectively running the anganwadis. The recent incidents of corruption in the disbursement of cycles and scholarships for village students prompted the panchayats in the block to intervene. Asks Shalini:', 'We need the panchayats to play a proactive role. We live here and know the people well. Why should elected bodies not be given the control to implement schemes for our villages?', 'Rahini Bibi, bock head of Danda (Garwa), has faced a similar challenge. According to her, when cycles for students were earlier being distributed at the district level, evidence had emerged of non-existent beneficiaries being included. “Now that cycles are being given at the block level, we can ensure that only those who truly fulfill the criteria get to benefit from the scheme,” she says. A high school drop out, Rahina is now pursuing her own education while working to get a girls’ college sanctioned for her block.', 'Women-headed panchayats are now taking seriously issues that were once dismissed as “trivial”. For instance, Archana Mahato of Muramkala Panchayat in Ramgarh block of Ramgarh district has taken up local irrigation. Thanks to her efforts to get wells dug in four villages, vegetable cultivation in these villages has increased. To compensate for the use of electricity to distribute water for household purposes and vegetable farming, the panchayats have fixed a water tax for those who are willing to pay. The panchayats now have four water pumps as well through which groundwater is pumped out. Since electricity supply is irregular a generator has been installed at the well.', 'If Archana has got wells built, Putul Tigga, head of Brombai panchayat in Ranchi district’s Mandar block, has ensured that a once defunct water tank in the premises of the government hospital can store one lakh litres of water. Today, it supplies water to local homes every day and on time. “We had lived almost all our lives without enough water to drink – that’s not the case now. Life has certainly changed for the better,” remarks Rajesh Kumar, 35, a government teacher of Ramgarh Boy’s School.', 'Another success story has been that of Shruti Deogam, the block head of Ghatshila, who could revive the Tussar silk thread mill in the area by organising self-help groups to start a small mill at the panchayat office itself. Presently 50 women are working in shifts to spin and reel silk treads with the support of the district administration and Jharcraft, an NGO working to develop craftwork in the state. “If this works fine the women in my region will be able to earn not less than Rs 6,000 a month,” she says proudly.', 'These are all instances of incremental but significant change brought about through the efforts of committed panchayati raj women leaders. They know they have a long way to go, but the process has begun well and is now unstoppable.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
4,2013-9,"['Archives', 'The Maharashtra Drought Relief Project: When Empathy Translates To Action']","['\n\n\nby\n\nIpsita Sarkar\n\n\nSeptember 17, 2013, 2:36 pm \n\n\n', 'In March-April 2013, Maharashtra suffered from what was probably the worst drought in 40 years. The people were once again at the receiving end of the wrath of Nature, as it took a heavy toll on the lives of the people on the parched lands. It also led to the formation of a youth organization dedicated to helping the victims and finding long-term solutions. This is what began as the Maharashtra Drought Relief Project, and is now called Yuva Foundation.', 'The Maharashtra Drought Relief Project germinated from an inspiring seed of thought of Soham Sawalkar and Aditya Sureka and blossomed in the month of March 2013 in some of the severely drought hit areas of Maharashtra. The initiative began when Sawalkar and Sureka heard the news of the most severe drought that the state had ever seen. It would have been easy for Sawalkar, who had been preparing for his CS examinations while working at a leading firm in the estate industry of Mumbai and for his friend-cum-colleague, Sureka, to sit back and express sympathy for the drought victims from the safety and comforts of their home and concentrate on their busy schedules. But they decided to stand up and take charge.', 'Armed with empathy, a willingness to help and a strong motive to bring about change, they initiated the project, inspiring youngsters around them to join in and take responsibility. It was this team of young minds, collectively called “Our Own People” who worked on this project. They visited the drought affected areas, and what they saw left a deep impression in their hearts. The poor condition of the people, the disastrous climate, and the consequences that led them to die of hunger and sun strokes strengthened their resolve to help out the villagers in distress.', 'Action Time\nThe basic objective of the initiative was to first, physically check the conditions and the requirement of the affected areas, and then provide the necessary food, water, fodder and other relief materials by collecting donations, preferably in the material form. Besides, the team planned to provide long term solutions to the problems being faced wherever possible.', 'The team worked in two phases. In Phase I, the team covered Maan Taluka and the corresponding villages. In Phase II, the team covered Ashti Taluka, Beed district and the villages that were included.', 'The work was divided among the team members based on their specific skills. For instance, the tech-savvy people in their project led the social media management. The people led teams in their areas, passing on information to others in order to identify people who would be interested in donating water and food. Applauding the invaluable utility of social media in times of such a crisis, Sawalkar, Project Coordinator says:', 'It has been the greatest tool in helping the team to spread the word. Strangers, who saw us on the social media, offered their residences as collection centers of their respective areas. Similarly we created different collection centers across the suburbs where all the collected packaged food and water was stored.', 'Likewise, more teams were formed on the basis of the tasks that had to be carried out. Another team played a major role in visiting the affected areas and conducting an intervention to analyze the needs in the affected areas. A special logistics team took care of coordinating and ensuring transport arrangements for all the materials to the respective villages.', 'The Donations\nDonations were given, keeping in mind the present, as well as the future needs of the people. Explains Sawalkar:', 'Donations were collected majorly in the form of food and water. Even PVC pipes were provided to set up a water supplying unit, in order to avoid such situations in the future. The donations in the form of money were used in transport and buying fodder for the cattle in these areas. Since people didn’t have food and water for themselves, even their cattle was dying without any fodder, which in turn led to more poverty as their source of income depended on their cattle.', 'The relief materials were dispatched by sending trucks to the villages and then distributing the items equally among the villagers. The team was privileged to have the support of many in this endeavour. One of the key mercenaries, Malati Iyengar (GM – Supply Chain – ISS Integrated Facility Services Pvt Ltd), helped the team to arrange a 9 tonne tempo for free, to carry all the collected goods to the drought-affected area.', 'Ground Realities\nThe team had its share of challenges to be overcome while executing the project. While at times, people questioned their genuineness and authenticity, there were still other times when corruption rampant even in the sphere of social service had to be dealt with. There were also situations wherein people would just inquire, get involved, take up a lot of time and then disappear without any particular contribution. However, every cloud has a silver lining. It was a simple plan of action that helped them sail through this testing time – To have a one-point focus on their goals only. It did help. Says Sawalkar,', 'There was a situation when we discovered that middlemen had involved corruption even in such miserable conditions; where they used to collect money from villagers for water tankers, and the amount considerably exceeded the actual cost! But on a good note, the Tahshildar at Ashti Taluka opened his office on a Sunday and supported us throughout the project phase in the villages. It was amazing to see such penance from Government officials.', 'The period of drought not only was a difficult phase for the villagers but also posed several obstacles for the rescue operations by the team. Surviving in the scorching heat even for a single day, was a task in itself, leave alone, locating and helping out the villagers in distress in these arid weather conditions and areas. However, it was probably this struggle in the heat that helped the team empathize even better with the painful plight of the villagers who actually lived in exactly these climatic conditions, with only broken roofs to shield them from the unrelenting sun and no money to mend their houses for shelter.', 'In what would be a distinguishing line of action, the team reached out to even the mystical, spiritual domain as a part of their ceaseless efforts to smoothen out the effects of drought. They invoked spiritual blessings, in order to get relief from the drought. They started a daily Prarthana (Prayer) where they meditated and offered their prayers to Mother Earth for the well being of the society. Their belief in spirituality aside, they had a solid rational reasoning behind this.', '“It is proven that our sounds create vibrations which affect the environment and surroundings. No wonder the scientists are researching on the effect of sound vibrations from a word as simple as ‘Om’. We followed the same concept. For if the law of attraction mentioned by Rhonda Byrne in her book “The Secret” actually works, then why won’t prayers from a calm, meditative mind work on nature? It did work.”', 'Fundings\nAwareness about this initiative is being actively spread by word of mouth and through social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. This has helped them receive a lot of support and funds, globally from people who want to lend a helping hand to the needy and affected. There are people from as close as their neighbourhoods to those living overseas, who have donated in money and in kind willingly. Sawalkar mentions:', 'Groups of people got in touch with us from various places like Pune and Surat. Shravan Purohit, from Surat, came all the way to Mumbai, after seeing our work on our Facebook page. He inspired his people back in Surat and helped in collecting donations for Maharashtra, even from Gujarat. Similarly, there were friends in the United States who collected donation from their friends there and sent it across here.', 'The initiative also saw its share of corporate social responsibility being undertaken through the active involvement of the corporate bodies. ISS Integrated Faculty Services Pvt Ltd helped out by providing free transport for nine tonnes of material in trucks during Phase I. Nice Systems Ltd provided 80 PVC pipes for installation at Vaghluj Village in Ashti Taluka, thus creating permanent solutions for water scarcity for the inhabitants of Vaghluj Village.', 'Receiving funds from willing donors was a different ball game altogether. Unexpectedly, what should have been a simple process of giving and accepting money, was what turned out to be caught in a complicated web of bureaucracy. However, who knew that it would be precisely this problem that would give rise to the formation of a new charitable organization by this team, united by a new name? Sawalkar recalls:', 'Often we were faced with questions and doubts from donors, regarding our genuineness. They would ask for bank account in name of the project. Since we were just a group of people who got together to bring about a change, without any affiliation to any organisation, it used to be challenging to buy trust. Donors often asked for 80G certificates too. That’s when we decided to register ourselves as a charitable society. We took this initiative after completing our Phase I of the project. Finally, we have completed the procedure of the registration. We’re now called – Yuva Foundation.', 'Future plans\nThe Maharashtra Drought Relief Project has today broadened its horizons and re-christened itself as the Yuva Foundation. They aim to not only serve people during a natural calamity, but also reach out to people in all respects. They already have another project called the “Responsible Citizen of India” in execution. Through this project, they inspire people to come together and start taking actions to get their problems resolved, instead of cribbing and complaining about them. Its objective is to make people aware that addressing their rights, as well as duties and responsibilities, however small they may be, can create a bigger impact.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
5,2013-9,"['Archives', 'TBI Social Enterprises: Dimagi – Applying Intelligence And Innovation To Health Care Solutions']","['Dimagi, which means ‘of the mind’, is a team of intellectually committed professionals who envision applying innovative, scalable, open-source technology solutions to improve community health programs around the world. Here we present the Dimagi founders, Jonathan Jackson and Dr Vikram Sheel Kumar, two enthusiastic young men with Harvard and MIT background!', 'It was in 2002 when Dimagi was conceived with a mission to deliver open and innovative technology to help under-served communities everywhere. It is a privately held social enterprise having its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'The enterprise has performed technical strategy, systems design, software development, and health research for over 130 projects in over 35 countries.', 'The group is very clear in its thinking that they explicitly wish to care about impact, team satisfaction, and profit (in that order). Jonathan Jackson and Dr Vikram Sheel Kumar, the founders and CEOs wish to share their vision and talk about their way ahead with our readers.', 'In building our business, Dimagi seeks a ground-up approach, applying a principal which we call ‘design under the mango tree,’ meaning that it is the end user and beneficiaries who drive the design and development of our tools. Our unique global network of field managers and partners constantly feed that innovation as we seek to be more responsive to the end user’s needs, while providing clear and actionable data for project managers. Our field engineers share experience and lessons-learned with each other, but cultural diversity has taught us the need to develop technology that is equally diverse and flexible.', 'It must be mentioned forthright that Dimagi has successfully focused on addressing the challenges of maintaining an effective community health program including limited training and supervision for front-line workers (FLWs). In order to realize the true potential of FLWs, we need systems that ensure all beneficiaries have access to timely, high-quality, and engaging care, and that all program managers have access to current and accurate data.', 'Our primary goal in addressing this challenge is to track and support front-line workers throughout under-served communities to further enable training, support, and supervision of local development initiatives in low-income countries. Ultimately we believe that empowering these FLWs through the application of mobile technology will result in better development outcomes. Expanding on our significant body of work in the public health sector, Dimagi has been looking to leverage our experience in addressing a wide range of development challenges in fields that include agriculture, gender-based violence, and emergency and humanitarian response, to name a few.', 'We could not resist asking the team Dimagi one question – what prompted them to focus on mobile technologies if only 20% of Indian population uses smart phones? Their answer was bang-on target.', 'Mobile technology is the way of the future, particularly in many developing countries where cellular phones have a significantly higher penetration rate than land lines and more conventional communications technologies. While we recognize that a relatively small proportion of the Indian population uses smart phones, we have designed our technologies to work on a wide range of devices from the high-end smart phones and tablets, all the way down to more basic Nokia feature phones. In fact, in many of the contexts in which we work, these more basic handsets are preferable due to their longer battery life and general durability. Moreover, access to smart phones and the myriad features they offer will only increase in the coming decade.', 'Team Dimagi also enlightened us about CommCare, their award winning health platform which was developed for use in the public health sector. On a fundamental level, CommCare transforms the conventional practice of a community health worker (FLW) – or any front-line worker, for that matter – manually filling paper registers and carrying large flipbooks. With CommCare, each FLW is equipped with an inexpensive phone running Dimagi’s open source software. The FLW registers clients using electronic forms that have been effectively used by low-literate FLWs.', 'During home visits, CommCare aids a FLW with real-time guidance through key counselling points, decision support, and simple referral algorithms. Each counselling point is reinforced by images, audio, or video clips that the FLW can use to engage their clients. We have found multimedia to be universally popular among both FLWs and clients, and there is strong evidence in the literature for the role of recorded audio to improve the persuasive power of health messaging. CommCare also submits visit data in real-time (who was visited, for how long, and what answers were given) to our central cloud server, CommCareHQ, where it is privacy-protected, backed up, and immediately made accessible to supervisors and program managers.', 'CommCare currently support numerous mobiles handsets from inexpensive Nokia phones, to high-end Androids phones and tablet PCs, allowing a range in economic scale. Dimagi team is closely tracking the data for the usage of CommCare.', 'As CommCare scales, they are also tracking the impact of operational processes on programmatic variables such as enrollment, visit rates, and length of visits as well as health indicators including client uptake of services and health outcomes including neonatal mortality.', 'They are working on many other successful projects all around the world.', 'In terms of adoption of CommCare, we have had almost 500 projects to date, nearly 200 of which are still active. Our current projects span 31 countries, actively tracking 60,000 beneficiaries. Last month we collected over 200,000 forms. These numbers are modest, but we are excited to see them double about every six months.', 'Team Dimagi is very hopeful about the bright future of information and communication technologies in health sector.', 'Since 2005, the National Rural Health Mission in India has trained and deployed 750,000 Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), a type of community health worker sponsored by the government of India, to provide proven health interventions at the community level. However, despite largely achieving its goal of enlisting ‘One ASHA for every village’, the ASHA program has been limited by persistent challenges related to training, motivating, supervising, and monitoring ASHAs. With funding from USAID, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and a range of NGO partners, Dimagi has been focusing our efforts on demonstrating the utility of mobile technology in over 40 projects across the subcontinent. Given the emphasis that the government has placed on the ASHA program, as well as the tech boom in the country, we are already seeing strong indicators that this sector is growing rapidly, with demonstrable benefits being passed down to the target populations.', 'The Dimagi team feels that their biggest and greatest achievement till date lies in empowering their partners, whether they be the M&E Officers who enjoy more accurate real-time metrics regarding their cohort of FLWs, or the FLWs themselves who receive better feedback, enhanced decision support, and better access to patient histories. Dr Vikram spoke in detail on how technology will play a key role in the future as well.', 'Technology has a significant role to play in enhancing communication, making accessible regions and communities that might otherwise have been left behind. As we have already seen through the action of bringing CommCare to some of these communities in India and elsewhere, we are better able to interact with patients in the comfort and security of their homes freeing up time for them to engage in other income generating activities. It is important to remember, however, that technology is only as impactful as those who are applying it. It is with this understanding of the human element of Information and Communication Technology for Development (ict4d) that Dimagi strives to design our solutions around people, soliciting user input and feedback from beneficiaries.', 'We appreciates Dimagi’s commitment and the way they are addressing global development challenges. As a horizontally structured organization, Dimagi prizes open, efficient, and continuous communication. At the core of their work is a big team of field managers, scattered across projects in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Each one of them operates on the principal that team satisfaction and the impact that can be achieved when we love what we do are paramount to our overall success.', 'Indeed, the mind gives its best when we all work from heart!', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

SEWA Rural is an organization that aims at improving the lives of these very deprived people. From healthcare to vocational training, they have been providing holistic development to the needy in Gujarat for 33 years now, and even today, they continue to serve the poor with utmost enthusiasm.', 'SEWA Rural (Society for Education, Welfare and Action – Rural) is a voluntary organization involved in health and development activities in rural and tribal areas of South Gujarat at Jhagadia since 1980. The activities were initiated by a group of young professionals with education and experience in India as well as abroad. The organization is based upon the ideals and ideas of Swami Vivekananda and Mahatma Gandhi.', 'It attempts to use the available manpower in order to reach out and aid the poorest of the poor and fulfil community needs through various programmes. The focus of these has been the more vulnerable members of the society, i.e. the women, children & elderly. At the same time, it tries to ensure that the values of the organization are well- preserved and self-development of all the people involved in the work is achieved.', 'Healthcare Programmes: \nSEWA Rural offers an extensive hospital service. The 100-beds facility offers round-the-clock emergency services, special care for women, children and people with eye diseases, and separate clinics for Tuberculosis, Diabetes & infertility. These services are strongly supported by a well-equipped modern laboratory, X-ray and ultra-sonography units along with operation theatres and appropriate blood storage facility. Medicines are available in the hospital campus at a low cost without compromising on the quality. Every year about 70,000 out-patients & 12,000 in-patients are treated; about 2,200 deliveries & 7,000 operations are carried out. About 35% of the out-patients and 75% of Indoor patients are treated free. Medical students and interns from India as well as abroad come to the hospital for regular orientation and training.', 'SEWA Rural satisfies primary and advanced eye care needs of the rural population of thousands, in the villages of Bharuch, Nandod, Suratand Vadodara districts along with border areas of Maharashtra. Their comprehensive eye programme encompasses all components of eye care – prevention, promotion and rehabilitation. Under this programme, Jhagadia and Valia blocks were made cataract free as per WHO guidelines. Under the Comprehensive Blind Rehabilitation Programme, elderly blind patients were given training for social mobility while the youth were trained for economic rehabilitation, and government schemes like certificate of blindness, free bus pass, pension scheme etc. were tapped.', 'A large number of social factors do not allow the vast majority to access the hospital facilities. This prompted SEWA Rural to commence a project of Healthcare at Doorsteps in 1982, initially for 10 villages. Later, it was expanded to cover 40 villages, and the government-entrusted Jhagadia PHC (Primary Health Centre) was managed for more than 10 years. Such innovative public-private partnership model in healthcare was experimented for the first time in the country.', 'Vocational Training:\nVivekananda Gramin Tekniki Kendra is another branch of SEWA Rural with a vocational training centre started in 1987 that offers training to about 200 underprivileged youths every year. The various trades include turner, fitter, welder, electrician, environment operator machinist, computer hardware technician, nursing assistant, etc. Ten months of theoretical and in-campus practical training is followed by first-hand exposure and experience of 2 months in nearby Ankleshwar and Bharuch industries, after which all the students are placed on jobs.', 'Training Facilities: \nMany organizations and individuals look forward to understanding and learning from the organization’s experiences. In order to facilitate this, a training centre was established in 1990 with modern facilities for which financial assistance was provided by the US-based Share & Care Foundation. Every year, more than 80 varied organizations and 1000 trainees benefit from this. Various workshops are also organised for the staff of SEWA Rural so as to enhance as well as reaffirm their competence, knowledge and involvement. On 18th February 2010, a newly constructed Health Training and Resource Centre was inaugurated with aid from Helping the MacArther Foundation and Govt. of India. The training centre is the first NGO facility to be recognized by UNICEF and Government of India for training in IMNCI (Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses).', 'Initiatives for Women:\nFrom the very onset, women have been at the centre of most of the activities of SEWA Rural. This concern has been transferred to an independent organization, Sharada Mahila Vikas Society (SMVS) since July 2002. The main programmes under SMVS are economic activities like papad and snacks and garment making, savings/credit programmes, self-defence training courses, education and awareness.', 'Recognition:\nSEWA Rural has received various felicitations for its outstanding contributions for the betterment of the society. These include Sasakawa Health Prize 1985 by WHO Geneva, MacArthur Award for ‘Creative and Effective Institution’, Pathdarshak Award 2006 by Rotary Club of Bharuch, Vivekananda Medal 2006 by The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture in Kolkata, etc.', 'Your donations can make a huge impact on the projects of SEWA Rural.

But what does it take to scale the corporate summit? Affected with Encephalitis at an early stage in life, and with 15 years of dogged perseverance to reach a reasonable level of speech and action, Sharmila Divatia rewinds her journey.', 'There was a time in Sharmila Divatia’s life when she dreaded summer afternoons. The Children’s Orthopedic Hospital in Mumbai’s Haji Ali area wasn’t quite the place to be for a school-going girl to spend her holidays at. ‘Where is my vacation?’, she would often ask her mother, as April dragged to May every year. She perhaps knew the answer, that there were no vacations as she was ‘different’, since a fateful day in 1970 when she went to sleep but woke up only four weeks later after a convoluted coma. It turned out to be encephalitis, a viral brain fever. Years later, Divatia’s first job was at a company whose office looked over the dreaded hospital. On the day of her appointment, she called her mother and asked a different question, “Can you imagine where I’m standing?”', 'The pudgy faced Delhi-born Gujarati lady has made peace with summer afternoons it seems, as we catch her at a multi-cuisine restaurant of a five-star hotel in Mumbai on a warm weekday. She is now Associate Vice-President at a top IT company but her recurring smile doesn’t flaunt that designation. “I like to be ahead of schedule,” she responds after we suspect having made her wait. “I’m at work by 8.30 every morning, and by the time the office opens and people begin walking in, I’ve already done much of my paperwork and responded to emails,” she says matter-of-factly. Having been an early-riser from over two decades of professional life now, it didn’t take much rescheduling of routines when she joined her current firm in 2003.', '“I’m a hard taskmaster,” she admits, in-between a main course of fish and mango daiquiri, “But when I’m off work, I’m a friend to my team. They (her colleague-friends) can talk to me about anything personal, we often go out together,” she explains. This ‘off work’ happens at five pm, when Divatia switches off in all ways and heads home. “There used to be a table booked at the Tunga (a popular suburban hotel) at 6.30 every single evening!” she reminisces. We can’t call her a workaholic then, also because she counters, “I’m just super-efficient!”', 'This efficiency blended with dogged persistence may be reasons why Divatia is at the top steps of the corporate ladder. Having begun climbing it in 1989, when Indians weren’t used to seeing co-workers with a disability, she faced regular attitudinal barriers. “My employers have always been good, it was the colleagues who took a while to accept that I was as capable, or better than them.” Her first decade, like of most others aspiring professionals in Maximum city, was a long journey, with the oases of increments well spaced out.', 'Maybe it was just in her DNA, or the 15-year ordeal of bettering oneself in speech and physiotherapy that made her tireless, but Divatia’s hunger for achievement is only growing at age 48. “I was lucky to work under very good bosses. I’ve never got the feeling that someone doubts my skills,” she explains.', 'That said, even a Six Sigma Black Belt (not a martial art qualification!) and an ‘ISO 9001 resource’ person such as her could have bad days, we mull. “Those are only when I have no work!” Divatia responds. Okay, but surely she must have been finding herself at the receiving end of undue sympathy, as most persons with disability do, right? (Divatia has never used a wheelchair, and her speech is clear, but for a slight oddity.) But no, her content, headstrong attitude is what keeps them away. “Nobody gives me sympathy. I think they’re afraid and feel intimidated that I don’t need anything from them.” For self-reliant persons with disability such as her, this keeps away much unnecessary negativity.', 'If any corporate hotshot’s success is measured by the quality of their weekends, Divatia top-scores there too. Although she stays by herself and doesn’t enjoy cooking, she’s an unabashed foodie and loves reading. Besides, being a visiting faculty at Mumbai’s Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Hearing Handicapped and the Asian representative of the support group Encephalitis Global Inc., she interacts and inspires many in the sector. Her hefty bio also reveals she’s involved with the government (and non-government bodies, for that matter) at several levels for policy-making, welfare initiatives and events such as the Olympics for the disabled. So to our assumption that her weekends must be packed, she says two words, “Very. VERY!”', 'Perhaps lying insignificantly among the accolades and awards that don her living space; there is a small, worn-out piece of paper that Sharmila Divatia has preserved through the years. It is her identity card from the Children’s Orthopedic Hospital.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Famed for its temple that promises marital bliss to the newly-wedded, and a fort that has played host to Shivaji, Jejuri is an enchanting place – full of myths, paradoxes and spell-binding tribal traditions.\xa0', 'Rajani, the Goddess of Night, had the complexion of night. She always wondered what she would look like if she had the complexion of the golden sun. Mustering courage to ask for the impossible, she climbed up to Mount Kailas. Prostrating at Shiva’s feet, she told him, ‘Lord, I am an unfortunate soul who’s forever dark. Could you bless me with a golden hue?’ Shiva was in a jovial and generous mood. Instantly he blessed her and said, ‘Your dream will come true. Go and lie down on top of Mount Skanda. After a while, you will disappear into the womb of Mother Earth and be reborn as the plant of turmeric that will have the complexion of molten sun. You will become the symbol of purity and auspiciousness. And when I descend on Earth as Khandoba, my favourite offering will be the powder of turmeric!’', 'As you walk up the hillock of Jejuri, you will find yellow clouds of turmeric wafting in the air, and softly landing on the 200 stone steps that lead you to Khandoba, the lord of the tribals.', 'Jejuri is situated 50 kilometres to the south-east of Pune, towards a town called Phaltan. You travel towards Sholapur, and when you reach Hadapsar, you turn right. Then you ascend Divey Ghat to reach Saswad, and then the temple town of Jejuri. Jejuri is the abode of the lord of the oldest tribes in Maharashtra, the Dhangars. They are an upright and valiant community of shepherds, and they are deeply attached to Khandoba as he had married Ganai, the daughter of a shepherd.', 'There’s a paradox about Khandoba. He has two wives: One is a goddess and the other is a shepherd’s daughter. In spite of this blatant bigamy, couples throng here soon after marriage, seeking a long and happy married life! And incidentally Jejuri is the only temple where a couple has to make the offering to the deity together, standing next to each other.', 'One of the main visual attractions of Jejuri is the deepmaala, or the garland of lights. There are two of them; tall, vertical columns carved in black stone. When lit up all at once on a moonless night, the shimmering flood of light created by these stone garlands is enough to rival the molten gold of turmeric that forever adorns the steps of Jejuri.', 'There are ritual songs sung by traditional families, on request, for the fertility of newly married couples. Armed with an ektaara, and blessed with a rustic voice, they sing without inhibition; praying for the marital bliss of couples.', 'But Khandoba, despite his demeanour of an easily appeased lord, is actually an angry incarnation of Lord Shiva, who descended on Earth to slay two demons, Mani and Malla.', 'Khandoba has an interesting martial symbol. It’s called Divti. It’s shaped like a dagger, but doubles up as a lamp. When it’s lit up, it looks like a flaming dagger; a symbol of light that slays darkness.', 'Interestingly, Jejuri is now a temple; but once upon a time it was a fort. A historic one at that because it’s here that Shivaji met his father Shahaji, after a long gap of 14 years, and discussed guerilla strategies to ward off the Mughals.', 'The temple that you see now is the new temple. The old one that inspired Arun Kolatkar to write the Commonwealth-Poetry-Prize-Winning ‘Jejuri’ is situated atop a hill three kilometres away. Describing the dilapidated condition of this temple like only he could, Arun wrote:', 'There’s a fascinating story about how the old temple moved to the new location. Many, many years ago, you had to undertake an arduous climb to reach the old temple. One of Khandoba’s devotees had been doing that daily, for over 50 years. One day, he realized that his mind is willing but his body couldn’t take it anymore. So he bid goodbye to Khandoba, saying that it was his last visit to the temple.\xa0The lord was touched by the words of his ardent devotee, and he told him: ‘Since you can’t come to see me, I will come with you and live in your house. But on one condition; you shouldn’t turn back to look at me when I’m following you. If you do, I will stop right there’. The old man’s joy knew no bounds, and he readily agreed. And the lord started following him. The old man thought to himself: ‘The lord has asked me not to look at him, but I can always keep an ear open for the lord’s footfalls’. But after a while, the footfalls stopped. Fearing that the lord had lost his way, he turned back. The lord froze into stone then and there, and a new temple was built around that idol!', 'Looking down from the temple you see Kaara River, in which Khandoba descends to take a cool dip on the moonless night of Somavati Amaavasya.', 'On that day, the joy of the devotees is a little more than ever; they sprinkle a little more of the turmeric powder than ever; and the steps of Jejuri become a little more golden than ever.', 'Gangadharan Menon is a nature writer, art teacher, and photographer of the wild.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

This is a story of sheer grit and perseverance. This is a story of putting Science and Technology to good use. This is a story of overcoming obstacles like corruption and red tape without compromising on your ethics. This is a story of transforming 95 acres of the ‘worst land in Rajasthan’ into a green campus of an educational institute. Read on.', 'Once upon a time in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, there used to be this vast land, forsaken by one and all. The highly saline wasteland had been rendered useless, infertile and barren. There was a reason why this 95 acres of plot had the distinction of being ‘the worst land in Rajasthan’. Nothing could be grown, nothing could be constructed and there was no water available on this land. That was in 2005. And then, suddenly it seemed that God showered his blessings like rainfall on this thirsty land.', 'Eight years later, in 2013, a different entity stands at the same spot, at Village Kaparda, Tehsil Bilara, District Jodhpur in Rajasthan. A bright, cheerful campus site greets you today. The land has transformed in colour, appearance and spirit altogether. It has become a greenbelt consisting of over 6000 plants and trees which have grown up to 12 feet. With a total of 15 lakes, made through rain water harvesting, it has a capacity to store around 6 crore litres of water with fishes, frogs and even tortoises in these. It has two large bridges constituting the rain water harvesting structures. This apart, the campus has three large size lawns of 2.5 acres each, with solar lights on the periphery of each and 60 benches made of fibre glass.', 'The campus that belongs to the Aravali Institute of Management is spread across 28,000 sq. feet of built up space housing the library, computer centre, classrooms, offices, guestrooms with attached bath rooms, electricity room, guard room and stores. There’s also a natural meditation centre, with a capacity to seat around 2000 persons, surrounded by 1500 plants. Today, the site not only invites several thousand students and guests, but also winged visitors in the form of migratory birds visiting the beautiful lakes.', 'The person behind this miracle, Varun Arya is a proud man as he recalls how this makeover was brought about, with the trials and tribulations that he faced in the process. However, the change didn’t happen overnight. The start to this difficult journey, for this IIT Delhi and IIM Ahmedabad alumnus, was marred with pessimism from all quarters. He says,', 'When I left a high paying senior position with the American multinational DuPont 12 years back, people called me a fool. When I chose Jodhpur in Rajasthan as a location for establishing the top-quality educational complex, people called me a big fool. And when I purchased the above wasteland, people called me a bloody fool!', 'The land where the Aravali Institute of Management stands today was geologically given the thumbs down by experts, recalls Mr Arya. According to ISRO, the campus land was an extreme wasteland and the development of the same for academic purpose was going to cost enormous effort and money. As per the Central Arid Zone Research Institute (Jodhpur), Ministry of Agriculture, the plot lay in a wasteland with high inherent salinity. The salinity also made building construction risky because of corrosion. The Arid Forest Research Institute also came up up with some unfavourable data classifying the sand texture as loamy and the soil depth as 25 to 40 cm (rock beneath).', 'We really had no choice but to purchase this land since no one else was willing to give us the land with entire payment by cheque. When we got into this educational entrepreneurial venture 14 years back, we had told ourselves that education, by definition, was based on ethics. No compromise under any circumstances irrespective of the difficulties, hardships, sacrifices and struggles.', 'While everyone was busy, pointing out the problems, Varun was focused on finding and implementing the solutions. In Varun’s words,', 'This painstaking transformation from wasteland to wonderland has meant a lot of learning from the first principles, many intuitive experiments which fortunately succeeded, enormous efforts with patience and perseverance and investing reasonably large finances.', 'English Babool: The purchased land was infested with English Babool, a plant that hindered the growth of other plants and made the land infertile. They had Magsaysay awardee waterman, Mr Rajendra Singh, called in to identify and repair the damage. Following this, they got a JCB machine to remove around 1500 English Babool from the site after several days of hard work.', 'Land earmarking: It wasn’t easy to construct cemented walls to mark the boundary of the land. The board declaring ownership would be destroyed by local protestors, engaging in reckless vandalism. Also, for the value conscious Varun Arya, paying sizeable cash amounts was never an option to get rid of this problem. Instead, on the advice of an elderly villager, they resorted to speaking to Darbar, ie Maharaja Gaj Singh of Marwah-Jodhpur, who sympathized with the situation. He amicably and peacefully settled matters with the local people, ensuring their co-operation in the project in future. Today, Maharaja Gaj Singh is not only a well-wisher of the project but also the Chairman of the Institute’s Board of Governors. The campus site is currently demarcated by a 3 kms long boundary wall.', 'Water harvesting: Cultivating the flora and fauna of the area was a task that required water. The team had dug up areas in the land for 6 lakes, each up to 10 ft deep, for rainwater harvesting on the advice of Mr Rajendra Singh. This was indeed a testing period. Remembers Mr. Arya:', 'We had to extensively use blasting since at most places there were rocks beneath. People laughed at seeing the dug up areas, questioning where so much of water would come from in the scanty rains of Rajasthan.', 'To their happiness, the 6 dug up lake pits got filled with 2.5 crore litres of water in a matter of an hour, with the heavy rains in July 2006. In fact, the water started to overflow with more than a month of incessant rain. But the excitement was short lived as within 3 months, the water had become saline. Saline water was of no use for either construction purpose or for growing plants. They had avoided lining the pits as it was a cost-intensive, non-environment friendly and temporary way of preventing salinity, besides blocking the underground seepage of water. So they relied on Nature to filter out salinity, and they waited for six long years. The salinity gradually decreased with every passing year, till in the sixth year, the water remained sweet throughout the year! Sweet are the fruits of patience and hard work! Encouraged by this success, the team went on to make more lakes on the land and the nearby areas.', 'Bridges: Another significant problem on this plot was that there was no proper inlet and outlet for excessive rainwater. The resultant (almost shoulder level) water passage would also make commuting an issue within the land premises. To sort this out, two bridges were constructed on both sides of the boundary in the line of this water passage. Today, these large bridges not only constitute the rainwater harvesting structures, but also enhance the beauty of the campus.', 'Plantations: Even thinking about plantations in a barren, highly degraded, saline land required courage. With the support of some experts however, this dream became a reality. With the advise and help of Dr. R. L. Srivastava, Indian Forest Service officer of 1978 Batch who was Director of Arid Forest Research Institute (AFRI) at Jodhpur, Mr. Narayan Dass Prajapati, Managing Trustee of Asian Medical Plants & Healthcare Trust at Jodhpur and Mr. Jagdish Kishwan, IFS, Director General, Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education of Ministry of Environment & Forests in the Government of India who advised AFRI to make the plot their experimental site, the team planted around 25 varieties of plants, some salt resistant and some normal ones. The major plants were Khara Jal, Karanj, Kasod, Neem, Peepal and Kumat. Mr Arya explains:', 'For all the plants, we first dug up a 1m x 1m x 1m pit in the rocky land using JCB. Then we got sweet soil from quite a distance and filled each pit with it after mixing it with traditional fertilizer made of cow dung and goat bits. Then the plant was placed surrounded by the tree guard. The tree guard helped us to place jute cloth around the plant in extreme summer to protect it. We also planted low roots, high foliage plants like castor and sunflower around each plant to protect these from the extreme heat in the summer. At those locations in our land where the salinity was the highest, we first placed a large multilayer jumbo bag and then put the sweet soil inside the said jumbo bag. This multilayer jumbo bag helped greatly in insulating the plant from the seepage of salinity and thus safeguarding its longevity.', 'Today, the site boasts of 6000 plants, growing up to 12 feet.', 'Lawns: In spite of saline land, the team was able to make lawns, initially of around 25 feet by 25 feet in less saline areas. Then they made lawns of similar dimensions in more saline areas as well by demarcating the peripheries of the lawn area with pebbles to raise the level of the lawn and placing sweet soil there. They made 5 such lawns. Gradually, they increased the lawn dimensions for 2 more lawns to 100 m by 100 m each. They installed the sprinkler system to water these lawns, planted Neem trees and also placed solar lights around the lawns. Today these lawns are a key attraction for students (for various activities and sports too) and visitors alike.', 'Salinity: When the land was purchased in 2005, it was thickly coated with salt. The problem was primarily combated with natural means that included rainwater harvesting, salt-resistant and salt-absorbent trees and plants and dhencha, a highly nitrogenous plant that greatly reduced salinity.', 'Construction: Salt blends with lime construction easily, but eats into cement construction, but construction with mudia lime (not easily available either) was 5 times costlier than construction with cement. So the team planned to use lime for construction only till the plinth level, where salinity came into contact. Above plinth level, cement was used for construction. The strength of construction with lime is the least initially but it increases over the passage of time. The strong 550 year old Meherangarh Fort in Jodhpur made with conventional lime is a prime example of this. On the other hand, the strength of construction made with cement is highest initially but it reduces over the period of time. Mr Arya reminisces:', 'Historically in Rajasthan, the mudia lime was processed using camels. Since we did not have camels, we again did our reasearch. We found a person in Didwana near Nagaur who used to make the machines for processing the mudia lime. We got two such machines custom-made from him. These were made operational using the tractor motor and it really worked.', 'The success of this experiment was proven to one and all when 3 years later, heavy rains in the region damaged the nearby Pichyak dam and other buildings, creating havoc in the surrounding villages and even came up to their site but could cause no harm thanks to the constructed 3 km long boundary wall.', 'Vegetation: With all the work carried out in the area so far, they have successfully been able to grow a wide variety of vegetables including aloe vera, cucumber, spinach, ladies finger, tomatoes, brinjals, radishes, carrots, etc. The extra effort put in to be able to grow these vegetables involved bringing sweet soil from outside and mixing it with the conventional fertilizer of cow dung and goat bits. The result was that the quality and taste of the vegetables was better than even their market variants. The quality was even lauded by Dr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission of India and his wife Dr. Isher Judge Ahluwalia, who visited their site in November, 2008.', 'Land conversion: Corruption was probably the most difficult obstacle that had to be overcome in setting up the institute. Mr Arya was neither prepared nor willing to compromise on his ethics to secure land meant for as sacred a cause as education. This, in spite of the fact that hurdles loomed large in the form of bribe- and ‘negotiations’-hungry politicians and top-ranking governmental authorities. Illuminating on his plight, Mr Arya says:', 'I met the highest authorities in the government but none of this helped in any way. Instead, with full force of state, the government unleashed against us several enquiries and false cases including concocted cases even for disturbing peace in the city of Jodhpur, death and molestation. There were attacks on me and my family members to make me surrender to the wishes of the netas and babus. However, I refused to buckle and continued to strive for results while persistently refusing to make any compromise.', 'It was only after several months of struggle and strife (including a period of fasting at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi) over what rightfully belonged to them and with the extensive support of IITs & IIMs alumni and faculty members, former judges & Chief Justices of High Courts, top officials, academicians, defence officers, social activists, media, lawyers, staff and students of the institute, and also the villagers there, were they finally able to get their due. That is, now they have successfully acquired the conversion approval for the entire 236 bigha of their campus site land.', 'Today, their quest for educational entrepreneurship as well as various other societal benefits continues. And they pledge to do this without compromising on their morals. The success story of the Aravali Institute of Management strengthens the belief that it is not only possible to transform a barren land into a greenbelt with hard work and determination, but also challenge corruption with the right ethos and positive values.', 'Photographs: Courtesy Aravali Institute of Management', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
