With no one left to support them financially, these women often find themselves unable to feed their families. Things are changing however, and due to the untiring efforts of one woman, there is now a support group for them which does not dole out charity but makes them capable of earning a livelihood.', 'Sometimes all it takes is one incident to transform one from being a mere spectator to a participant in change. For Binalakshmi Nepram, that moment came on a gloomy Christmas eve of 2004 in a village near Imphal, the capital of Manipur. As an academic researcher she was talking to a group of women activists, when gun shots shattered the peace. In the flash of a second, one of the women in that meeting – Rebika Akham, 24 – had become a widow.', 'Nepram recounts what happened, “We were at Wabgai. The gun shots sounded less than a kilometre away, leading to the death of a 27-year-old man.” The victim, Buddhi Moiranthem, had been dragged out of his car battery workshop by three assailants and shot at point blank range. To date, his wife and family have no clue about who his killers were, or what their motive was.', '“Rebika, all of 24, stood with us, shell-shocked. Amid the crying, I remember her mother’s helpless words, ‘Now how will I feed you?’ That was the turning point of my life,” says Nepram. It was then that she decided to set up a support system for women left isolated because of the violence around them.', 'Growing up in Manipur – a state that shares borders with Myanmar, as well as with the other north eastern states of Nagaland, Assam and Mizoram – which is possibly one of India’s most conflict-ridden regions, Nepram understood even as a child that life was uncertain given that armed violence was a regular occurrence. “My parents tell me that even on the day I was born, there was a conflict raging and my father had to scramble for the medicines that my mother had needed. Violence cast its shadows on our very minds,” she says.', 'When she joined the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi in 1997, she shared some of the realities of the region with friends and classmates, who often could not comprehend the extent of violence that marked everyday life in Manipur. “They could not believe it when I told them that people could actually disappear and not be seen alive again,” remarks Nepram. In JNU, Nepram began systematically researching into the situation, often travelling in the state to collect primary data. But despite her research, she was unprepared for those gun shots that rang out in 1994, changing a young wife into a widow in an instant.', 'Soon after that killing, Nepram collected Rs 4,500 to buy a sewing machine for Rebika Akham, so that she could earn an independent income and stitch together the pieces of her life again. With that the Manipur Women Gun Survivors Network also came into being. Nepram points out,', 'I realised there is no point in doing endless research if there was to be no intervention. There are so many young women, just in their twenties, who have been widowed overnight. Children have lost their fathers; mothers, their sons. These women needed help to start their life afresh.', 'She also realised that monetary relief was, at best, temporary relief and that soft loans were perhaps more appropriate. The Network then took on the role of providing small loans to women victims and helped them open their own bank accounts.', 'The lives of many women were turned around in the process. Take the case of Huidrom Tanya Devi, 18. Her father’s untimely death 10 years ago shattered her young life. A karate instructor, he was gunned down by the armed forces in 2001. The young girl still asks in a haunted voice, “Even today I don’t know the reason for my father’s death. I ask everyone, what crime did he commit to meet such an end?”', 'The Network gave her mother, Huidrom Geeta Devi a loan of Rs 3,000 in 2007 with which Tanya was able to start a small business. As the months rolled by, her confidence as an entrepreneur grew. This April, she became the proud owner of a shop that sells embroidered dress materials, incense sticks and household goods. Two other women have similarly set up their own shops with the Network’s help.', 'Mumtaz, another victim, whose husband, a lecturer by profession, was killed in gun violence in 2009, was in a similar distress. With five children to look after, she couldn’t be more grateful when the Network extended her a loan of Rs 8,000 to run her business.', 'Her success as an entrepreneur has whetted Mumtaz’s interest in public life. She now wants to contest the local panchayat elections in order to help bring change in her village in the Thoubal district of Manipur. She also links up affected women like her to the Network and is, in the process, contributing to the expansion of an initiative that had started small with 25 women survivors of gun violence and today reaches out to over a thousand.', 'The first of its kind in South Asia, the Network has 150 are active members, most of whom had been victims themselves. The assistance they render is multi-pronged. The immediate need of women who have been bereaved is a support system – some regular source of food, the continuation of their children’s education, and the like. Then comes the need for a sustainable income. Loans are provided to address this requirement, with the money put to use in setting up a small vegetable vending enterprise or acquiring a loom to weave cloth.', 'The Network also provides legal assistance to the women to fight their cases for justice and compensation since they themselves are most often too poor to afford lawyers. Medical assistance is provided to take care of the health needs of the affected women. The Network does this by entering into arrangements with doctors who are willing to provide free check-ups or dental care.', 'In order to function smoothly, meetings are held every two months in an informal setting – like the courtyard of a member’s house – to discuss individual problems as well as general issues, like the treatment accorded to widows in society. Nepram comments,', 'In many parts of India, when a woman who has lost her husband wears bright clothes or takes up employment outside the home, eyebrows are raised, questions asked, and motives ascribed. This is simply unfair – it is only right that women in such circumstances try and reclaim their lives. Girls, as young as 21, are widowed in an instant. Surely they have the right to live a normal life?', 'The Network meetings are not just to discuss problems, but are also meant as a time of togetherness over tea and snacks. The idea is to reach out and explore ways to address common problems. “We can only reach a limited number of women. If the government wants, it can connect with lakhs of them, but that would need political will,” observes Nepram. She emphasises that the Network is apolitical. In any case, politicians generally stay away from such interventions. Not only has no Member of Parliament come forward to be associated with the work the Network is doing, ministers in Manipur have actually mocked its efforts. But for Nepram this only points to the great lack of sensitisation among politicians to the gender dimensions of violence.', 'The lack of political response has not, however, discouraged the women members of this unusual Network. Right now, they are busy studying government schemes for women and children and searching for ways in which they can benefit from them.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Rahul Cherian belongs to the latter. A partner at a Chennai-based law firm specialising in intellectual property rights and other laws, he is also the force behind Inclusive Planet, a centre that connects the disability sector with the government and policy makers.', 'The 38-year-old is a cancer survivor himself. After having surgically removed it from his spinal cord in 1989, he underwent reconstructive surgery in 2005 and now uses crutches. Today, Cherian is one of the experts drafting the Treaty for Visually Impaired persons currently being negotiated in Geneva, where he loves driving his hand-controlled car. We caught up with the man to know about his peculiar routines, insights about law-makers and his pet project, a social network for blind persons.', 'What’s your regular day like? Is policy-making and law stressful?\nI don’t keep a regular schedule because I invariably end up breaking it! Most days I’m found working till midnight and yes, it is very stressful managing all these diverse activities.', 'How diverse are your roles at Indojuris and Inclusive Planet? What are your motivating factors at both?\nThe roles are completely diverse. At IndoJuris, the deliverables are within my control, whereas at Inclusive Planet, as there are so many moving parts including the government and the disability sector, I have to be extremely agile most of the time in what I do. Moreover, policy making has a longer gestation period and at times there is a flurry of activity in each area and then there are lull periods. It can be frustrating at times… but can also be extremely rewarding when the policy I have been working on becomes a reality!', 'In this hyper-connected world, where does your ‘social network for visually impaired persons’ stand? How many people is it still relevant to?\nInclusiveplanet.com is specially designed for persons with visual impairment to interact with each other in a digital environment. It’s fully accessible for all who use screen readers. In an era of Facebook, here we have a one-of-a-kind social network that has the potential to impact millions of visually impaired persons from around the world!', 'Tell us how your legal and policy work plays out. \nSee, I get requests from the disability sector, I pick the relevant ones and help conceptualise them. Then, we prepare documents; raise funding if required, meet MPs if that helps. For instance, a disabled person once wrote in when the Centre was drafting a new aviation policy, and thought we must intervene. We researched and wrote to them. People do not recognise that every law has some impact on persons with disabilities, whether it’s related to banking, air travel, education, electronic delivery of government services etc. I am up to try and change these laws and policies.', 'Is working with the state difficult? Must a common disabled person need strong contacts to see change?\nIt’s not as tough as it seems! The machinery of some states is smoother than others. We get requests from governments too; the Kerala Planning Board wants to make the whole state ‘inclusive’ by 2025. We’re planning actively with them… and they’ve already allocated 40 crores for it.', 'I’ve found many politicians and bureaucrats to be very committed too, provided you do all the leg work! Before the Copyright Act amendment, we had met a CPI-M member of the Rajya Sabha, who promptly arranged further meetings and we now have an important bill passed.', 'What does this Copyright Amendment Bill 2012 mean for the disabled?\nIts biggest takeaway is that now persons with disabilities will be able to access reading material on an equal basis with others. Also, the government cannot hide behind copyright restrictions to deny educational books to students with disabilities.', 'A major learning for me here was to understand how to convince Members of Parliament on disability related issues. The secret is to practically demonstrate the possibilities of an enabling law rather that an emotional or legal argument.', 'Does being a person with disability yourself help you here?\nI’ll be frank and say yes. It does help get more legitimacy from within the sector. Otherwise you know how lawyers are looked at! You do have an edge when you meet a bureaucrat, but then it of course depends upon your approach and research.', 'How has it affected you personally though? \nI don’t think that being a PWD has affected my career or my emotional state.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
2,2012-11,"['Archives', 'TBI Change-makers: Dr. Ram Kataria – The Man Who Created The Gandhians Farm']","['\n\n\nby\n\nShruti Nambiar\n\n\nNovember 23, 2012, 11:01 am \n\n\n', 'Dr. Ram Kataria has dedicated 12 years of his life in converting a barren patch of land in the parched interiors of Maharashtra into an oasis using innovative and indigenous methods of conservation and sustenance. What’s more, he has many more ideas for inclusive growth including the creation of a school for rural change-makers. Meet the man with boundless energy and infinite vision.', 'For decades, Dr Kataria had a comfortable medical practice and a beautiful home in Manchar, off Pune. But when his two sons moved out and found their own feet, he started planning on acting on an issue that had long troubled him. He had always been close to nature, and passionate about gardening. But at the same time, he was disturbed by the environmental legacy his generation is set to leave behind for posterity. He decided to sell his house and relocate to a place where his vision for change could take shape.', 'The shift happened in 1999. Dr Kataria bought out tracts of land owned by family members and partners, and ultimately had to his name an expansive, bone-dry patch that covered 100 acres in Kadus gaon in Taluka Rajgurunagar, about 50-odd kilometers from Pune. He still recalls being called “crazy” by friends and family alike when he let go of his home. “But my madness is my strength,” he chuckles.', 'More than 12 years have passed since The Gandhians Farm first started taking shape. Dr Kataria conceptualised the look and landscaping of the place, and roped in the labour of villagers living around. Together they spent countless hours in mud and sunshine, planting and nurturing the over one lakh trees and plants that stand there today. Some of these villagers have built humble homes inside the farm. Depending on the season, 50-70 people could be working in the farm at the same time. The untiring doctor himself is on the ground at 6am daily, and walks around the sprawling farm, planting more saplings, watering the plants, clearing stray twigs from the many narrow paths that criss-cross the farm, and chiding the people around him for littering.', 'Though the most obvious change is the farm itself, the impact of what Dr Kataria has started is more widespread, and multi-pronged. The Gandhians property’s heart is in conservation, not just of the environment, but of the human resource too. Says Dr. Kataria,', 'It is important to harness the local human energy. People who stay in the rural areas are the true producers, and we need to develop ways to keep them here and not migrate to the cities. We need to give them jobs, build their confidence, and help inspire and hone interests.', 'He sums up his vision in six words – Swaccha (clean), Sundar (beautiful), Green, Sajala (redolent with water), Sashakt (self-sustaining) and Anandi (happiness).', 'The Gandhians Farm is remarkably self-sustaining in terms of its water usage, well provided by its 11 rain-fed mud dams. Most of the close-to-100 species of plants in the farm are carefully selected local species, with other additions from outside being fruit trees like papaya and sitafal. Some trees have been planted to provide nesting grounds for an interesting number of birds. Water is a precious commodity in this area with 800mm of average annual rainfall, and an excruciating number of hours of electricity load-shedding. Water conservation is therefore paramount – the farm uses a drip irrigation system, and re-uses as much water as possible. “You don’t need to employ major expertise to conserve; simple, local techniques are just as effective,” says Dr Kataria.', 'As the farm gradually found its feet, Dr Kataria realised that people need to come in and see what is possible. So, when the\xa0Pune-located, community-based travel company\xa0Black Swan\xa0approached him with the idea of a day-trip, he was thrilled. “It makes me glad, that young people are interested in knowing about this.” Six years ago, his son Anand initiated the building of an eco-friendly resort called Ananda Valley within about a third of the area of the farm. This place offers eco walks across the farm, and has attracted a steady influx of people every week.', 'But Dr Kataria’s boundless energy is the beating heart of this place. The soft-spoken doctor can hold forth on subjects ranging from the sad state of Indian rural health, to Anna Hazare, to Bollywood – all in the course of one conversation. Apart from running the farm’s activities, Dr Kataria continues to practice medicine three days a week in Manchar. He has been a family physician for 45 years, and harbours a deep interest in the subject of psychology.', 'In the midst of all this, a new idea has managed to take hold of his conscience. “I want to help build a grameen vidyapeeth where anyone who has an idea for change can come and learn how to realise it. The vidyapeeth will have people who will assist every prospective change-maker with know-how and constant guidance,” says Dr Kataria.', 'The most critical aspect of this project is of finding the right spot to build the vidyapeeth in – a preferably hilly area, with a 200 acre spread close to the tehsil. “The cities have all resources readily available to them, and the city-dwellers have no time to spare. They don’t need us! The change has to begin in the rural interiors of our country, and villages need to be made viable. This will not be an organisation, but a movement. It will utilise the expertise of retired people and help address the root cause of all social problems,” Dr Kataria says.', 'This change-maker is always on his toes, always willing to learn, and will always remain an inspiration. “As citizens, the changes that we wish to see around us, must reflect in our personalities as well,” he always likes to say.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Gangadharan Menon takes us on a rich voyage of discovery where he unearths the history, meaning and evolution of Warli Art. And he does this in the most interesting way possible – by meeting and studying the Warli tribe: their traditions, folk tales and everyday life!', 'It all started four decades ago: in the early 70s. Pupul Jayakar, the woman who unearthed many an Indian folk idiom, along with her field assistant Bhaskar Kulkarni, was on a voyage of rediscovery. First they rediscovered the rich and colourful Madhubani art, and then the amazingly spartan idiom of Warli art that shunned the use of all colours except two: brown and white.', 'Jivya Soma Mashe, one of the accomplished Warli artists of the time, was invited to New Delhi for a demonstration of their art. In front of unbelieving eyes, on a sheet of brown paper, Jivya drew the figure of Paalghaat, the Goddess of Fertility, sitting in the centre of an intricately drawn temple. When prodded to draw more visuals, Jivya drew a blank. He sheepishly admitted that this is all that every Warli artist knows to draw: the ritualistic drawing of the Goddess which is painted on the walls of a Warli house on the day of the wedding.', 'According to Phiroza Tafti, the convenor of the Dahanu Chapter of INTACH, Jivya was encouraged by Pupul Jayakar to break the shackles of convention and depict the rich mythology and the evocative legends of their tribe in their own inimitable Warli style. Jivya came back to his native village and had a meeting with other fellow artists. And once liberated from the strict traditions of ritualistic paintings, the floodgates were opened and out flowed thousands of distinctly different Warli paintings: depicting their myths, folk tales and daily life. And Warli art moved from the depictions of god to the depictions of mortals.', 'On our visit to Dahanu in the North Konkan belt of Coastal Maharashtra, Phiroza Tafti offered to take us around the padas, or the villages, of the Warli tribe and share her experiences with us. Right from the time she came to Dahanu as a newly-wed city-based rebel who made the chickoo orchard of her husband Jehangir her permanent home.', 'A pilgrimage to the Waghoba Mandir was first on the list. Here we saw idols carved on totem poles. The totem pole was a relic from pre-historic times and the idol was a symbol of their contact with the rest of the world. Originally, the Warlis never worshipped man-made idols. The shaman of the village on his sojourn to the nearby hills would pick up small rocks that spoke with him in positive tones. These would be kept under trees, and they would then become their places of worship. Over many centuries, influenced by mainstream religions, the weather-beaten stones eventually took man-made shapes and temples were built around them.', 'While inside the shrine of the Tiger God Waghoba, Phiroza insisted that we sit down and feel the vibrations of the place. And indeed as we closed our eyes in deep meditation, a certain calmness soothed our souls. Was it the sound of the brook that flowed nearby that we heard, or was it the sound of the stream of consciousness?', 'The Warli people are a simple folk with simple beliefs that govern their lives. According to Yashodhara Dalmia, an authority on tribal arts and anthropology, the Warlis are frugal in their habits and speech.', 'A Warli woman, before she cooks supper, asks her family members how many ‘bhakris’ would each one of them eat that night. And she would then make exactly that number. When Yashodhara asked the woman why she does this every day, day after day, the woman replied, `These bhakris are cooked on the back of Kansaari, our Goddess of Harvest. Why give her more pain than what’s necessary?’', 'Another unique character of this tribe is that they speak very little, almost in monosyllables. That’s because the Warlis believe that words have an uncanny habit of suddenly becoming real. So they ensure they don’t speak anything untoward lest it becomes true!', 'Probably in sheer contrast to this frugality, every Warli artist pours his heart out while painting. Though the figures are graphic, devoid of details and colour like cave paintings, they are surprisingly rich in their choice of subjects: human figures in various situations, gods, trees, plants, and animals both wild and domesticated. Even the minutest ant finds place in their paintings. As Yashodhara puts it so succinctly, `They are rich, yet hieroglyphic in effect.’', 'Since Phiroza had to rush off to the school where she teaches, she assigned us to Yashode, her trusted Warli maid of 30 years. Yashode turned out to be more Warli than most: in terms of using words. While giving directions as I was driving, she would just point her hand to the left or the right without speaking a single word!', 'She took us to the house of Jaanu Ravte, a promising young Warli painter. First he took me to his studio, which he shares with six other artists of his co-operative. Then, after a cup of tea, he took us around his house that was barely lit by a skylight on the tiled roof, and a lone, small window. It was a wall such as this, smeared with mud and cow-dung, that was the original canvas of Warli art. And staring at that dingy wall, I understood why the Warlis don’t use colour but a white, rice-based paint to create their artworks. The sparkling white of the rice-paint gleams in the under-lit house, catching even the faintest of sunrays that come in reluctantly. Giving the painting a truly ethereal feel.', 'Seeing Janu paint was a revelation. His hand was an extension of his mind, and his brush was an extension of his hand. It started with a basket and around it he weaved a tapestry of Warli life, all in a swirl of perpetual motion.', 'Today, in response to the art market, villages after villages have taken up Warli painting; and in many cases the raw, creative energy has been replaced by static, decorative motifs that are saleable. Underlining the fact that a painting becomes a work of art only if it’s created by the forces inside, and not the forces outside. And it’s left to artists like Jaanu to uphold the fabulous traditions that have been transferred from one paint-brush to the next, across generations.', 'Gangadharan Menon is a nature writer, art teacher, and photographer of the wild.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Shishu Sarathi in fact became the first institution in Assam to cater specifically to the needs of children with cerebral palsy.', 'I interned there for two months and I recall that summer as my best ever.

These children were wild and free and were always full of courage. They wore their guts on their sleeves. I have never seen fear in their eyes, they were always on the move, wanting to learn more, explore more and do the impossible. Performing stunts was the common craze with most of them there, leaving us fascinated and enchanted by their spirit.', 'Every morning when i reached there, they would welcome me with their best smile, hold my hand and drag me inside the class. They enjoyed their activities and since painting is my favourite, I partially dragged them into the world of colors and in turn they taught me how never to bother about what you want to paint but be really proud of the outcome, whatever it turned out to be.

6,2012-11,"['Archives', 'TBI Heritage: A Glimpse Into The Rock-Cut Art of Elephanta Caves']","['This is not a story in the true tradition of The Better India. This is not a tale of inspiration or a reason to celebrate human courage or spirit of innovation. This is a call to action. We will be doing this from time to time. So that we do not become too complacent. So that we do not forget that WE also need to do something to shake up the current state of affairs, to improve things around us, to BE the change-makers instead of only reading about them. There are issues like these which need our urgent attention, before they are lost to eternity, and WE NEED TO ACT TODAY! We would love to know your thoughts on how we could, as a community, take responsibility for our monuments and heritage .', 'UNESCO World Heritage Site, Elephanta Caves, dating back to 4-9 AD, lies 7 km from the shore on the mainland of Elephanta Island while the Island, originally named, Gharapuri/ city of caves, lies about 11 km north-east of Apollo Bunder in Mumbai. Carved out of solid rock, the Elephanta caves feature some of the most impressive statues of Lord Shiva, in his various forms and avatars.', 'Except during the monsoons, the ferries leave from the Gateway of India around 9am in the morning in every half an hour duration while the last ferry from the caves leaves around 5.30pm in the evening, on all days except Mondays. Thousands of tourists, who come to Mumbai, make it a point to explore this historical site. The entire sea journey to the caves is breathtaking, especially the view of the huge ships standing tall in the midst of the huge Arabian Sea and the scenic view that the vast sea offers to the tourists.', 'In 1534, Elephanta along with the islands that were to constitute Bombay went under Portuguese control. By then sections of the caves were already in ruin, damaged by weather and nature’s forces. It is reported that target practice by soldiers may have also damaged a few sculptures. Later, the Marathas occupied the island in the 17th century. In 1774, the English took control of the island. Unchecked destruction within the cave site continued under British rule and it was not until 1909 that the main cave was declared a protected site under the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act.', 'The sculptures in these caves are considered representative of ancient art forms – especially that of the Chalukyan empire and the Gupta kingdom. The three temples stretch out from Stupa Hill to Canon Hill, but it is the temple in the centre – the Main Temple – that is grand and exquisite. It’s dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva (the Destroyer in the Hindu Trinity), and showcases Shiva in all his different forms. Massive square-sided pillars support a ceiling that is believed to have originally been painted. Right opposite the entrance, dominating the wall, is a huge sculpture that depicts Sadashiva, the three faces or embodiments of Shiva. There are other depictions of Shiva too – as Nataraj, performing the cosmic dance of destruction; as Yogeshwar, the lord of yoga; as Ardhanareeshwara – half man and half woman and – in his most romantic form – as Kalyanasundara, the loving and gentle bridegroom in his wedding with Parvati. All of the sculptures, including those of the eight dwarapalas (guards of the gate) surrounding the sanctum sanctorum with its Lingam, are intricate and beautifully decorated.', 'In addition to being a seat of culture, Elephanta is an ecological treasure, home to myriad species of fauna. Kingfishers, Pond Herons, Plovers, Magpies, Kites, Bulbuls, Drongos and Minivets, Paradise Flycatchers, Rhesus, Bonnet and Macaque species of monkey as well as numerous butterfly species can be easily found on the island and its forests. However, today the island has become more of a fragile zone getting highly impacted by the industrial developments from Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, Butcher Island, petrochemical installations, the nuclear plant at Trombay and the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. Besides, plastic bags flutter outside the caves and the tetrapacks can be seen floating around the water cistern damaging much of the environment of the island and posing a danger to the survival of the rich and rare species.', 'To the right of the main cave, an asbestos sheet is fitted in an attempt to ensure the water from the roof of the caves flows into a natural well below. The ASI installs the sheet every monsoon. The caves are cleaned using chemicals. However, the defaced head of a lion that stands guard at the lingam shrine in the east court of the main cave shows that the caves lack adequate protection and upkeep. The question then remains as to what happens to the funds that are given to protect the caves. The main planning goes around utilising the grants from the government to install dustbins, create garbage pits, beautify the jetty, build toilets and put up signage across the island. Graffiti is widespread and water seepage is an issue the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is struggling to cope with. Further, ad-hoc construction has led to mismanagement on the island. It is quite evident that the area requires stricter regulations and proper utilization of monetary resources.', 'Nearly 90 per cent of locals thrive on Elephanta tourism. The closure of a heritage site such as this is not only unimaginable and beyond reason but would also pose a big economic trouble to the locals of the island and to the image of India’s tourism in general. The caves are too precious and sacred to be lost.', 'As protectors of the world’s heritage, archaeologists need government support to protect these historical sites which are in a debilitated state. They can’t fight on their own to save the monuments but we as citizens together can help them in protecting our precious sites so that the future generations are able to get a glimpse of our rich heritage.', 'The question then is will generating media awareness around the state of our crumbling heritage spots actually improve the lot of the ASI, and help in preserving a few more collapsing monuments? We certainly hope so, and this is our effort in that direction.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
7,2012-11,"['Archives', 'Bijli Bachao – Now Save On Your Electricity Bills And Learn Of Energy Efficiency']","['To the world, Abhishek looked like a happy content professional working with one of the largest consulting firms in the world. Armed with an IIT degree, that is how it was supposed to be or that is how everyone thought. It was the year 2008, he was working with Deloitte, USA; he married Manisha, an energy efficiency engineer working with TERI. Together they came back to India in the year 2009 and little did he know that she will provide the fuel to the energy inside him. They bought a house like any other couple and started setting it up. Manisha was careful about what to buy and what not. The attention she paid to the kind of lights, refrigerator, air-conditioner to be put in the house was immense. Abhishek took the cue. He always wanted to do something on his own, now with Manisha’s interest and expertise in energy efficiency, he knew exactly where to begin. He quit his job with Deloitte and dedicated himself fully into the concept of energy efficiency.', 'Energy efficiency has been identified worldwide as the least cost measure for climate change mitigation. One of the major challenges that energy efficiency in India faces is lack of credible information to the consumers. The challenge is even bigger for smaller consumers such as households, small offices/shops and SMEs. While there are a wide range of options available to consumers to save electricity and reduce bills, many a times, they are not aware of these options. Government undertakes various initiatives to promote energy efficiency in small consumers by way of awareness creation, appliance labeling, discount/exchange schemes on appliances etc. However, it is observed that despite the large benefits that the consumer will get, the uptake of such schemes is very low. Two of the most common reasons are 1) the consumers do not get to know about the scheme 2) the consumer do not understand how the scheme will benefit them and how much will they save in their bills.', 'Due to increasing costs of electricity in all the parts of the country, there is an increased willingness to learn ways to keep the consumption in control. In order to do so, it is essential to first monitor the consumption. It requires knowing your appliances, how much should they consume, how much do they actually consume and is there a scope for reducing. It is important to make a note here that energy efficiency is different from energy conservation. In energy efficiency, the same level of comfort is derived from efficient use of energy.', 'How does Bijli Bachao help us achieve Energy Efficiency?', 'With the backdrop of energy efficiency as the concept, Abhishek launched a website – www.bijlibachao.in. The site was intended to disseminate information about how to use various electrical appliances and to help people understand how much they are spending on various appliances. Abhishek and Manisha themselves undertook experiments and then shared information on how electricity could be utilized in the most efficient way. It gives small and important details like what temperature should the AC be set on or where the refrigerator in a house should be placed. The site extensively also covers how to read the electricity bill. In fact, Abhishek himself makes a point to read his own electricity bill and compare it with his neighbors. In any given month, when they spend close to Rs.1500, the neighbors end up paying Rs.6000. After spreading awareness broadly about energy issues, he plans to gradually move to finer details. For example, an electricity bill calculator has been put up on the site which any person may use to understand the components of the electricity bill for a residential unit including the expenditure on each appliance. This will be eventually developed into a calculator that can be used for commercial complexes as well.', 'Since its launch, the website has garnered a lot of interest and gets several visitors in a day. Estimating the actual impact of such visits on changes in patterns of usage will be definitely very difficult. The impact will be different for different types of consumers. There will be some consumers who are completely unaware of the concepts of saving electricity and the website helps them take their first step for saving. There will be others who are looking for specific information about specific appliances and the website helps them by providing such information.', 'But for Abhishek and Manisha, the work does not stop here. They want to get to a level where they can help people completely decode their electricity bills, and understand where they are spending more, and how it can be reduced. They are building several software components for the same, some of which (for refrigerators, water heaters, fans and lights) are already available on their website. Along with the software, the tips on the website help in understanding how electricity consumption can be reduced for various appliances. They have also started a monthly newsletter where they provide latest updates and newest electricity saving tip on the website along with seasonal tips.', 'As part of their initiative they are also planning to start a service ‘help@bijlibachao’ where individuals can contact them on Internet and get their problems related to electricity savings resolved. The service will be more personalized and they will provide tips relevant to the person asking for help. They have also started working with residential societies in Mumbai, helping them save electricity and trying to work out ways to reach out to many more societies in the country.', 'At later stages, Bijli Bachao plans to offer its stakeholders many more products and services in this space. The stakeholders will include manufacturers and suppliers of energy efficient products in addition to energy consumers and also policy makers. Some of the future products and services will include online audits, database creation and management and a market place for energy efficient products.', 'Bijli Bachao is a small step from ignorance to awareness in the wake of the rapidly depleting resources of the nation. It dreams of helping India towards sustainable development, an India where there is electricity for all, an India where there are no power cuts and an India self-sufficient in meeting its own energy needs.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
8,2012-11,"['Archives', 'TBI Heroes: Protecting Daughters In Patriarchy’s Heartland']","['Amid all the depressing news we have been receiving on the deplorable situation of the girl child in India, especially from the northern patriarchal states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, here are a few stories that give us hope. These are women, and also some men, who have adopted and cared for abandoned little girls despite their own dire conditions, and many times against the wishes of their family. This is courage and compassion in its purest form.', 'It was a cool and quiet afternoon in October 2010. Nirmala was walking back from the Community Health Centre (CHC) in Savansa, a small village in Maharajganj block, Jaunpur district of Uttar Pradesh (UP). Her mother was working at the health centre as a ‘dai’, or trained midwife, and she had gone there to meet her. That’s when she heard a strange mewling sound.', 'Nirmala narrated the story, “It sounded like a baby was crying, but I looked around and there was no one around. Then I discovered that the sound was emanating from the storeroom of the health centre.” The room was not in use, its window panes were broken and there was a lot of rubbish strewn around.', 'Continued Nirmala, “I opened the door and what I saw made me shriek. A newborn baby was lying on the pieces of broken glass wrapped in a torn vest. The baby must have been crying for a long while – its face had a bluish tinge, and its mouth was parched.” Even as she recalled this, tears roll down her cheeks. This incident changed her life.', 'The first thing Nirmala did was to pick the baby up and breastfeed her. She was able to do this because she had only recently stopped feeding her six month old daughter. She then tried to find out whose daughter this was, lying so helplessly amidst the debris of an abandoned room. She went to the nearby hospital to try and locate the real parents, but no one could give her any information.', 'Eventually, Nirmala brought the baby home and had her treated at a private nursing home in the city since there was no facility for proper childcare at Savansa. That was when she came against a huge challenge. She already had three sons and a daughter. Her husband and his family could not tolerate the thought of having another girl child in the family. This led to a serious disagreement between Nirmala and her husband, and before long she found herself thrown out of her matrimonial home along with the children.', 'Nirmala, and her brood of five, found shelter in her parents’ house. Endowed with a sense of self respect, she decided to work as a labourer to support the now much extended family. Finances ran low. She and her brothers together earned less than Rs 6,000 every month – hardly enough to support a family of 15. Yet, fortunately for Nirmala, her parental family had no problems with welcoming its new member. The child, now named Ankita, is today a much loved member of the household.', 'Nirmala was one of several courageous women of the state to have fought with her own relatives to save the life of a baby girl. The social action group, ActionAid, which has been working on the issue of India’s skewed sex ratio through its campaign, ‘Himmat Hai Jine Ki’ (Courage to Live), honoured her – along with 14 other women and two men, who have, despite their desperately poor personal circumstances, adopted girl children abandoned by their biological parents.', 'The honours list included Sunita Yadav from Hisaba village of Baghpat district, who had brought home a five year old girl whom she found begging on a village pathway. Named Puja, she is studying in Class Five in a private school today. Then there was Rekha, 45, a midwife from Chitrakoot district, who despite being a mother to seven children and a grandmother to three, adopted an infant girl abandoned at the hospital by an unwed mother. “Since the mother was not married she asked me to kill the child. I couldn’t do that, so I took responsibility for that innocent life,” said Rekha simply. She named her child Pari, or fairy. Rekha’s husband is a rickshaw puller. Fortunately, he did not object to his wife’s action.', 'Another woman honoured by ActionAid was Shivkumari, from Kuthound block of Jalaun district. She comes from a fisher community and has personally influenced 13 women from seeking sex selective abortions under family pressure.', 'These illiterate, marginalised women and men have shown their ability to understand the basic principle of gender equality in a predominantly patriarchal society like that of northern Indian, where son preference is the norm. According to the latest Census figure, UP’s child sex ratio stands at 899 girls for 1000 boys, which is much lower than the national average of 914/1000, a figure that is itself disturbing.', 'According to Debabrata Patra, Regional Manager, ActionAid Lucknow, what was alarming was that this decline was no longer confined to the districts closer to Delhi and Haryana. Said Patra, “It is widespread across the state. It cuts across all classes and rural-urban divides.” This despite the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Technique (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse), or PCPNDT, Act, which criminalises sex selective abortions.', 'Vatsalya, a Lucknow-based organisation, which has been relentlessly working on curbing sex selective abortions, analysed the data from the 2001 and 2011 Census to estimate the number of missing girl children. Said Dr Neelam Singh, Chief Functionary, Vatsalya, “Going by the statistics, over 700,000 girls are missing between 2005 and 2011. This means that at the national level, more than 100,000 girls go missing every year, which means more than 10,000 every month and over 300 every day!” She reiterated the need to implement urgently the PCPNDT Act in letter and spirit, even as efforts to change mindsets carry on apace.', 'But clearly there was something to be learnt from the actions and responses of the 15 women who went against the grain and demonstrated to their community, and the world, the value of the life of the girl child. Joanna Kerr, International CEO, ActionAid, who was present when Nirmala and three others were being honoured, put it this way, “I praise, respect and salute these women who have saved so many lives.”', 'She went on to narrate her own story, “In 1966, my mother was pregnant with her third child. She already had two daughters and was keen to have a son. I was already named Andrew. Since there was no technology at that time to determine the sex of the child, I was allowed to live. If my mother had not allowed me to be born I wouldn’t have been able to meet so many courageous women today. In the same way, there are so many prime ministers, engineers, doctors, scientists, who are not with us today only because they were not allowed to be born.”', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
