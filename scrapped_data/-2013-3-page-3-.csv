Besides the ‘tech’ factor in their name, their space is filled with young faces who could well be designing gadgets, creating new apps – stuff new India seems to be high on these days. Fact is, Barrier Break is indeed doing the above, though only in the field of disability. And what’s more, as we realize on seeing a young man hobble from one desk to the other, over 70 per cent of the office is disabled. Priti Rohra, Head – Accessibility Testing & Development, is one of them.', 'Taking effortless strides in crisp formals, Rohra leads us to what looks like a meeting-cum-exhibition room. Several gadgets here, of whose functions she explains later, have been tested under her watchful mind. To Rohra, her over eight-year-long stint with Barrier Break, one of India’s few ‘accessibility testing’ and ‘assistive technology’ firms, has been a chosen career path, for she has Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), a genetic form of blindness since she was three. It didn’t come easy though, she tells us of the stereotypical black hole of vocations that are offered to blind persons in India. “NAB (National Association of the Blind) offered me training to become a telephone operator; there was also that option of taking up handicraft making.”', 'But then this was the turn of the century, and opportunities, unlike certain attitudes, were changing in India. Some networking led Priti to her current employer, which had set up shop in 1995 and has had a disabled-friendly outlook since. “I started as a tester. I’d go through websites, PDFs, play flash games, be a recipient of e-learning solutions,” she reminisces, and much has changed from the beginning of her stint to now, when the technologies are advanced, the advocacy stronger and the accessibility solutions for the crores of disabled persons slightly better, if not vastly. “Ten years ago, there were no announcements at railway stations the way there are today. It makes a huge difference,” she gives an example.', 'Truth be said, we are today interviewing Priti because she was supported by an able family who let her pursue a career of her choice and hone her skills. Or else, the nudges of the system to the blind toward ‘handicraft-making’ and other clichéd vocations continues. “I’ve been a very lucky child. While my parents never raised me with any deferential treatment (Priti has a sighted brother who she looks up as a mentor), they allowed me to be free,” she admits.', 'The result is that the lady is now more than self-sufficient in social settings, and a motivational force at work. Heading a team of two now, Rohra has gained considerable experience in this sector, and speaks with insight. “It’s an untapped market still in our part of the world, and can only flourish with required support from the government,” she talks of products in mobility, learning, visual impairment and other disabilities. She also knows that change must happen from bottom-up, and we guess that she’s hinting at more women like her coming up in the field in the future. Through careful programmes, not luck.', 'The ‘untapped market’ is quite an intriguing phrase, for Barrier Break isn’t another not-for-profit initiative. It is rather a social enterprise, and obviously has to look at its bottom line for sustenance and growth. As we glimpse into the workings of the products in the room as introduced by Rohra, it really feels like a different world from the perspective of an ‘accessibility tester’. There are computer keyboards with huge keys, adapter switches quadriplegics can use to seek attention (versus the classic ‘thread being pulled by teeth to ring bell’ manner), there are magnifiers, scan-and-read devices, gadgets for children and much more. With the current e-commerce boom in the country and a viable climate for entrepreneurs, this might be great news for disabled people.', 'It’s an interesting career stage for Priti, who’s just taken a sabbatical and returned to the same company. “I want to participate globally. There are some business ideas in the IT sector (diagonally different from her family business) I want to carry out with my brother,” she thinks loudly.', 'Well, as long as path-breaking employers keep mushrooming and technologies continue their strides ahead, it’s only an upward curve for the Priti Rohras of India. May there be many more.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

This is our first ever crowd-funded video project and if you wish to make a contribution towards it, click here', 'TBI Heroes: An Amazing Indian Who Aspires To Empower People']","['He has the courage to raise voice against the social evil of bride trafficking, enslaving and exploitation of women. He has the passion to inspire and lead a 300-kilometer ‘March Against Female Foeticide and Gender Inequality’. He has the perseverance to fight all odds because he wants to build an India where women will live with respect and equality. Meet Shafiq ur Rahman Khan, the founder of ‘Empower People’.', 'Even as a teenager, Shafiq Ur Rehman Khan was furiously active and stood upright for the education rights of Dalit children and other excluded communities in Gaya (Bihar). He always wanted to work for those people who were dying of hunger and starvation and for those who were forced to sell their children to traffickers to earn some food.', 'He was recently honoured with the ‘Amazing Indian Award’ by Times Now because he rose above the norms and worked single-mindedly for the cause of rescuing girls who fall victim to “bride trafficking.” He is still as humble and one can see the passion for social welfare in his eyes. We caught up with Shafiq to know more about the mission and the man himself.', 'I, along with my teenage friends, decided to launch an organization to work for the livelihood and education of the Dalits way back in 1999. Within six month, we were able to expand it in 23 blocks of Gaya as well as in Aurangabad, Nawada and Jehanabad of Bihar and Chatra, hazaribagh of Jharkhand. But a group of naxalites was not happy with our social welfare concept and continuous physical attacks made us shift to Delhi. The big city widened my horizons but narrowed down my focus. I realized the menace of human trafficking is one of the worst problems for India. EMPOWER PEOPLE was launched in 2005 in New Delhi as a dedicated participatory campaign against gender inequality. In 2006, our group marched from Jind to Hisar for a social mobilization campaign involving villagers who joined us to fight against female foeticide. Again in 2012, we organized a march against bride trafficking – a typical awareness generation and sensitization programme based on peoples’ participation and interface between Government/NGOs/NPOs officials and vulnerable communities.', 'So what made Shafiq so committed to help all those girls who were deceived in the name of marriage and exploited sexually/physically?', 'Honestly, social welfare has become a style statement these days. People consider it elite to run or be a part of some NGO. I have never believed in any elaborative ideology. Seeing someone suffer in the hands of others, seeing girls getting sold for less than hundred bucks and living the life of slaves, seeing how girl children were killed in womb – all these were good enough a reason for me to focus on the issue of human trafficking and gender inequality.', 'And how does he do that? The whole world should know how Empower People rescues brides who have been the victim of human trafficking.', 'Empower People works on the concept of community participation. We have vigilance committees in many parts of North India who keep us updated whenever they see a girl or woman in trouble. After getting any such cue, the first thing we do is to contact and convince local stakeholders and religious or ethnic leaders to rescue that girl. Simply because, the society itself has to empower the women! After garnering support from local people, our group conducts the rescue operation. We also register an FIR with the local police. Police, generally, are not willing to rescue such girls but they come forward once they notice the local support. The problem does not end with just rescuing; there are very few women shelter homes. Even these few ones are not properly maintained and lack basic amenities. So we make sure that the rescued girl is accepted back in her village or society and is able to live a normal life in her own environs. Community level sensitization workshops and other activities are our engagement tool to carry out all these activities.', 'That indeed sounds great! Shafiq also talked in detail how ignorant poor people fall prey to bride traffickers.', 'Bride traffickers generally target people who can’t marry their daughters due to dowry or other social stigmas. Prosperous states like Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Kerala are the hub for international bride traffickers and poor states like Assam, Bihar and West Bengal are facing the trouble from domestic bride traffickers. We need to make society aware that if someone is offering an unusual help for marrying your daughter, it is better to say No and report such people to Police. Parents, who are marrying their daughters abroad, should inquire in detail about the boy and his family.', 'Shafiq also elaborated on how an aware society and active youth can uproot this evil.', 'Awareness and promotion of equality is necessary to tackle all the problems. Women empowerment is not different from community empowerment; we believe in community empowerment with a fifty percent leadership participation of women. There are many ways we all can contribute to women empowerment. A simple contribution like changing profile picture of your Facebook profile can help us in making this issue popular. Our group needs volunteers who can write or translate on behalf of us. We need financial support also to carry out some operations. The youth can join our group and contribute directly to building a better nation where our women are not forced to live the life of sex-slaves!', 'The best thing about his group is that it promotes community-based sustainable livelihood once the girls are rescued. Many such survivors have been trained by his group in commercial farming and they are doing very well for themselves now. Shafiq proudly recounted the story of a few brave trafficking survivors who are now a part of his group in combating the problem. Survivors like Ghaushia Khan (rescued by his group); an illiterate woman is now a nominated member of District Legal Aid Authority in her village. Many others like Usha Kumari and Jamiya Mariyam has become the head of village-level units of Empower People.', 'As an inspirational personality, Shafiq stands by his concept of making people the real instrument of change through awareness and participation. He believes in a holistic understanding about the notion of ‘Violence Against Women.’ Rather than working in project-wise schemes or with limited focus, he wishes to address the problem from the very root and plans to have a mass movement and an ideological campaign within the society against female foeticide and gender-based exploitation.', 'We salute his cause and support him through our communication network. To build a progressive nation, it’s time to take a step towards empowering people. Empowerment comes with awareness; so let us all contribute a little by talking about such people and organizations.', 'You could visit Empower People’s website to know more about their work, or like their facebook page!', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

For years, they were forced to work as bonded agricultural labourers by the landed gentry of the region. The past decade has seen them fighting for their rights, and now with the help of some local NGOs, governmental support and their own unified efforts, they are slowly reaping the benefits of their struggle to be treated as free and equal citizens of this nation. Anumeha Yadav revisits the tribe to report on how they are faring.', 'For the last two years, Sahariya adivasi families in Baran district on Rajasthan’s border with Madhya Pradesh have waged a powerful struggle against generations of slavery to local landlords. Since November 2010, more than 200 Sahariya families have refused to work as ‘halis’ – bonded agricultural workers – in return for small loans on which landlords charged 40 to 70 percent interest. Last year, The Better India had published an article detailing the freedom struggle of this tribe, and their efforts at re-building their lives. We revisit the tribe a year later in this follow-up report to see how these erstwhile halis are faring with their new-found and hard-fought independence. Last month, 135 Sahariya families in Kishanganj block in Baran district sold the first portion of crop harvested on land they reclaimed from Sikh, Jat, Dhakad landlords.', '“Last July, the former district Collector B Sarvanan held a public hearing for us to register our claims. The district administration then restored 625 bigha land encroached by landlords in Sunda village to 135 Sahariya families. Initially, there was fear that the landlords will retaliate so women from Sunda, Amroli, Kherla, Lakhimpura and Dabka stayed back near the land two months during the rains. We sowed mustard in 400 bigha, and wheat and coriander in the rest,” said Gyarsi Bai Sahariya a community worker with NGO Jagrut Mahila Sangathan (JMS). “The mustard from just 50 bigha fetched us Rs 1.5 lakhs, we may earn upto Rs 20 lakhs from the whole harvest,” she added.', 'Among the most vulnerable families among Baran’s Sahariyas have found a crucial support in finding a new means of livelihood in MNREGA\xa0(The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005). Since 2011, hundreds of Sahariya tribals families trapped in bonded debt to rich landlords since decades have found employment under MNREGA.', 'Sahariyas are categorized as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribe (PTG), i.e., the most marginalized among tribes. The Sahariyas living in Baran came to national attention in 2000-2001 because of several hunger deaths in the community. The death of 47 Sahariyas because of starvation in the drought in 2001 triggered the Public Interest Litigation in the Supreme Court on right to food. Hunger deaths were reported among Sahariyas in 2004 and again in 2009.', 'In 2010, the NGO Sankalp and Jagrut Mahila Sangathan (JMS) organized a ‘Mazdoor Haq Yatra’ in four blocks in Baran with support from the Soochna evum Rozgaar Adhikar Abhiyaan Rajasthan. The yatra went on for 15 days. Following this, a ‘mazdoor satyagraha’ began in Jaipur on 2 October 2010. At this non-violent protest for minimum wages under MNREGA, the Sahariyas from Baran spoke up about having to work as halis, or bonded labourers, for landlords who had usurped their lands. They narrated how they had had lost their traditional access to tendu leaf, gum, timber as the forest deteriorated and become indebted to Sikh and Jat landowners who charged 40 to 70 percent rates of interest as halis or bonded agricultural labourers on their farms. The Bonded Labour (Abolition) Act 1976 bans hali among 31 forms of bonded debt.', '“I borrowed Rs 4000 and worked without wages on Hansraj Dhakarh’s farm for six years. I worked from 7 am till after sunset. But he would beat me mercilessly if I missed work even one day,” said Om Prakash Sahariya at the Jaipur ‘dharna’ (non-violent protest). Arjun Sahariya said he remained hali all his life and made both his sons work as halis in Khyawada village after borrowing Rs 15,000. Several Sahariya families lived on upper-caste landlords’ farms with restrictions on their movement and in some instances, were dependent on them even for food grains.', 'Following a protracted struggle by the Sahariyas, in 2011 Rajasthan government waived off their bonded debt and entitled Sahariya families to 200 days of work under MNREGA, twice the national norm. Beginning October 2010, more than 250 Sahariya families have found work under MNREGA here.', 'Sahariyas in Sunda village and Eklera village created a ‘credit fund’ of their own, starting by pooling Rs 100 each from their MNREGA wages. In Sunda village in Kishanganj block, there are three such savings groups of Sahariya women, and four savings group started by Sahariya men. In 2012, forty families in Sunda-Chainpura started building a grain-bank with their labour to pool together the foodgrains they got under the Public Distribution System, so that they do not have to rely on landlords for food.', 'The Sahariyas in Baran reached a decisive step in their struggle for self determination when the district administration recognized their claims over land seized from them by landlords. In July 2012, administration re-surveyed and gave possession of 625 bighas of land back to 135 Sahariya families. Using two tractors and seeds provided by the Area Development Committee officials, and fertilizers and fuel provided by Jagrut Mahila Sangathan (JMS), a local NGO, 15 Sahariyas families who had farming experience planted mustard over 400 bighas, wheat over 50 bighas, and coriander on 40 bighas, leaving the remaining land fallow. The remaining households continued to work under MNREGA.', 'Though earlier there were delays and we received MNREGA wages only after three to four months, for the last three months we have been getting their wages within 6-7 weeks and that is a lot of support.', 'said Kishore Sahariya, 35, who worked as hali on landlord Paramveer Singh’s farm in Sunda village since his childhood after his father who was also hali died. Kishore earned no wages and had a bonded debt of Rs 36000 to the landlord but refused to work against debt anymore after he heard about 16 labourers beginning resisting landlords in Eklera village.', 'Last month, the Sahariya families harvested the mustard planted in 50 bighas and earned over Rs 1,50,000 by selling their crop in the agricultural markets. With support from the District Vigilance Committee and JMS, women from all 150 families plan to now set up a cooperative society. Their brave struggle for their freedom, the work they found under MNREGA and their being able to reclaim their rights over land has enabled these adivasi families, among the poorest in the country, to live and work as equal and free citizens.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
3,-2013-3-page-3-,"['Archives', 'TBI Offbeat Travel: Living in a Small Hamlet in Remote Arunachal Pradesh']","['\n\n\nby\n\nYoginder Sikand\n\n\nMarch 22, 2013, 9:46 am \n\n\n', 'Yoginder Sikand takes you on a daring trip to a remote part of the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh. It is not for the faint-hearted or the luxury-seeker. You will not be observing exotic wildlife or grandiose architecture. But if you are a daring adventurer who can rough it, want to experience a unique sense of oneness with nature and have a deep love for primitive cultures and tribal traditions, you will not find a more perfect place than this!', 'It is definitely way off the conventional tourist map. Located in the far eastern corner of Arunachal Pradesh, in the Changlang border, near the trisection of India, Burma and Tibet, Diyun is a large village, the major market-place for dozens of tribal hamlets in the vicinity. That is where I spent two months earlier this year, volunteering as a teacher in a school.', 'Diyun boasts almost nothing of conventional tourist interest. Till recently, almost the entire area, stretching from near the border with Assam till the towering mountains of the Patkai Bum range of the eastern Himalayas that straddle the Burma border, was under dense forest cover. Only a few tribal families lived in the area, in scattered bamboo huts, engaging in fishing, hunting and jhoom—or shifting cultivation. Then, in the 1960s, the area was completely transformed, when thousands of refugees from the Chakma and Hajong tribes, who lived in what was then East Pakistan and is now Bangladesh, fled religious persecution and were settled here by the government. Today, the vast majority of the inhabitants of the ‘Diyun Circle’, as it is called, are Chakmas and Hajongs—who are mostly impoverished small cultivators, fisher folk and craftsmen. In addition to them are small pockets of other, more powerful and prosperous tribes, including the Mishmis, Nagas, Mossangs, Singphos and Khamtis.', 'Because the ‘Diyun Circle’ doesn’t have a long history, it does not have any historical monuments that might attract travelers. It did boast, several decades ago, of dense forests, which abounded with wildlife. Today, however, only small patches of forest remain in the plains, and even in the mountains large stretches of forest have been indiscriminately felled to make way for fields. Selling timber is lucrative business for some, while for others it is a means for sheer survival. Rampant deforestation around Diyun (and, indeed, all over Arunachal Pradesh, which once boasted of being one of the most densely-forested states in India) has meant that there are hardly any wild animals left in the area. Some decades ago, elephants, bears, leopards and tigers were common around Diyun, but with their natural habitat destroyed and large-scale poaching it is rare to spot even the state bird of Arunachal Pradesh – the hornbill – in the area. The only wildlife that I got to see were a couple of giant spiders, a bison, snake and the common white stork.', 'Since there is hardly any wildlife left and no major monuments in the area, it is hardly surprising that few visitors ever pass through Diyun. But for the traveler with an interest in tribal culture, Diyun – and, I suppose, other parts of Arunachal Pradesh, too – is a fascinating place. For the more anthropologically-inclined traveler, for whom travel is not simply about gazing at grand centuries-old palaces and forts but is also a means to witness and understand the living cultures of ‘ordinary’ folk, some days in and around Diyun is sure to be an immensely rewarding experience—as indeed it was for me.', 'Almost every afternoon, over the two months that I was in Diyun, I would walk or cycle through the neighbouring hamlets to witness a way of life that is fast disappearing in the face of the relentless march of ‘modernity’. It was not at all easy traversing through slush-filled pathways or fording streams on foot or finding my way in the jungle, but that was the only way to do it – there are hardly any paved roads in the area and only an occasional bus that connects a few hamlets. Hardly anyone owns a vehicle here and so the only sound one is likely to hear while winding one’s way from one hamlet to the next is that of the wind blowing through clumps of bamboos, of birds chirping in the trees, of frogs croaking in the ponds, and of village kids having fun in the fields.', 'You could spend hours in and around Diyun, as I did, paddling through brooks, watching men smoking pipes made of long shafts of bamboo, women working in the paddy fields and ducks floating in little pools. You could hike to the banks of the enormous Dihing river to see the sun set over the mountains and watch tribal people lay fish traps made of bamboo poles or hunt for insects under the boulders scattered on the river banks. You could observe village youth assemble a hut, with just a couple of bamboos for the frame, straw mats for the walls, wooden poles for the stilts, dried leaves for the roof, and a log of wood with broad slits in the middle for stairs. You could watch old men make delicate cane containers to be used for worship, baskets, cradles and hand-fans. You could witness young women working at their looms, creating exquisite, brightly-hued sarongs and towels. You could join a group of women (it is almost always women, and, particularly, elderly women) walking several miles in search of a stream to fish in, balancing giant bamboo-made fishing baskets on their heads. And not to be missed is the amazing bi-weekly street market, where different tribes, dressed mostly in their traditional brightly-hued costumes, buy and sell local produce – grains and vegetables, hand-woven dresses, and fruits from the jungle which you won’t be able to recognize.', 'Most of the ethnic groups in this area claim to be Buddhists. You could chat with a friendly monk, or simply squat doing nothing – which is what some forms of meditation are all about – in a Buddhist monastery. Almost every village here has a Buddhist temple, and most of these are built in the distinctive Burmese pagoda style. You could even trek into the jungle to spend some time with ‘forest monks’, who live all alone in whatever is left of the forest, meditating through much of the day and coming down to the villages only in the mornings to beg for food. On every full-moon and new-moon day, villagers flock to the monasteries to listen to discourses by the resident monks. You won’t understand a word of it all, of course, but it is an experience not to be missed. You might even be able to attend a Kathin Chivar Dan Puja, when hundreds of women from the Chakma tribe gather in the Buddhist temples to weave robes to offer to the monks.', 'If you are fortunate, as I was on numerous occasions, you might be invited to people’s homes for a meal or a cup of tea, and then you could end up spending hours chatting with your hosts to learn about what life is like for people living in one of the most remote parts of a state which itself is one of the most remote in India. You would learn that the Chakmas and Hajongs, who form the majority in this area and are among the poorest communities in the state, continue to suffer neglect from the authorities, their villages having almost no state-sponsored development schemes. Hardly any of them are employed by the state government. You would learn how ‘development’ and ‘modern education’ have come as a mixed blessing for the tribals, bringing material comforts for some, but at the cost of the rapid destruction of local traditions. You would be shocked to learn about the pervasive and deep-rooted problem of drug addiction in the area and about the immensely deleterious impact of television in the area, with Bollywood heroes replacing tribal elders as models for the youth to emulate.', 'If you feel you’ve had enough of Diyun, you could consider cycling – as I did – some 20 kilometres to the nearby town of Miao, crossing an enormous river, which comes roaring down the Himalayas. There is no bridge here, and so you will have to walk half the way on foot, in almost knee-deep, emerald-blue water, and then cover the rest of the distance in a country boat. There is not much to see in Miao, but there is a small Tibetan refugee settlement that you might find interesting. The town’s other supposed tourist attraction, a little zoo, is in a complete shambles – the assortment of Himalayan bears, porcupines, snakes, slow lorises and monkeys that it boasts of are trapped in miserable little concrete prison – like enclosures that are bereft of any greenery or mud. But the journey to Miao, which takes you through stretches of forest, through Chakma, Naga and Singpho villages, and past several little Buddhist temples, is itself well-worth it.', 'You might like to make a short trip to the Namdapha National Park, which can be approached by road from Miao. Spread over some 2000 square kilometres, it is the largest protected area in the eastern Himalayas. Its habitat ranges from sub-tropical evergreen forests to alpine meadows and perennial snow-capped peaks, and it still boasts, despite illegal poaching in the vicinity, of considerable wildlife. You could also consider a hurried trip in a truck to the Hindu pilgrimage centre at Parasuram Kund, near the Tibetan border, beyond the town of Wakro, home of the Mishmi tribe. The road passes through lush green fields and then dense forests, interspersed with orange plantations, till it reaches the mighty Brahmaputra, which comes noisily tumbling down the mountains.', 'As elsewhere in much of Arunachal Pradesh, there are hardly any facilities for tourists in and around Diyun. It isn’t safe, too, especially after dark, with reports of extortions and kidnappings. And, then, there is the additional problem of underground groups which are active in the area. But for those with a bit of daring, it promises to be – as it was for me – a richly rewarding learning experience.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
4,-2013-3-page-3-,"['Archives', 'TBI Videos: Magadh Jal Jamaat Helps Revive 2000-year old Flood Water Harvesting Systems in Gaya, Bihar']","['\n\n\nby\n\nAmita Bhaduri\n\n\nMarch 20, 2013, 10:31 am \n\n\n', 'Magadh Jal Jamaat, a loose network of progressive individuals in Gaya has been successfully able to revive over a dozen abandoned water sources and have instilled in people the need to create, clean up and conserve several lakes and ponds in the region. The problem of water scarcity had been of late afflicting the region, which once had a good system of ponds. But through their efforts, the group has managed to revive the traditional methods of irrigation, which are now more effective than the largest irrigation system in the area. Here we present two videos, created by Magadh Jal Jamaat and sourced from India Water Portal, which explain how they achieved these inspiring results, along with the transcript', 'Magadh is centrally located in the present area of South Bihar. Its southern part is undulated and rocky while the northern part comprises of plains. There are plains ensconced within the undulated areas too where good agriculture has prevailed through the millennia. An elaborate network of ‘ahar pynes’ (traditional water harvesting systems) have provided irrigation to the region, which was able to support the ancient Nalanda University and feed over fifty-two water bodies in the area, which is constantly swarming with pilgrims.', '\n“Apna Pani – Apni Pahal” – A film on Magadh Jal Jamaat’s work on reviving the ahar pyne systems in Gaya, Bihar – Part I', 'The area receives an annual average precipitation of over 1100 mm, most of which falls during the monsoon months from June to September. Drawing upon centuries of experience, people built ‘ahar pyne’ systems, to divert the floodwaters through ‘pynes’ and stored them in ‘ahars’. Ahars are reservoirs with embankments on three sides and are built at the end of drainage lines such as rivulets or artificial works like pynes. Pynes are diversion channels led off from the river for irrigation purposes and for impounding water in the ahars.', 'It is mostly to the credit of these systems that paddy cultivation has been possible in this otherwise relatively low rainfall area, when compared to North Bihar. The system attained its highest development in the district of Gaya.', 'While the state had a role to play in the construction of the systems they were largely managed by the people in a collective mode. Modern development brought in hand pumps for drinking water purposes but very soon the decline of the aquifer led to them going defunct. The ahar pyne embankments got dilapidated, pynes became conduits of waste water and ponds became the new dumping grounds for solid wastes.', 'Rivers became big sewer lines and their beds were encroached for real estate purposes. The lakes meant for pilgrimage too got fouled and their water was no longer of bathing quality. Dug wells that brought up the water with diesel-powered pumps started drying up and the supply of their water for the kharif season crop declined. The land could no longer support the families who lived on it, and this led to widespread migration. People got ever more alienated from community institutions which became weaker. They did not have time for community work such as maintaining ahar pynes, a final blow that rendered the systems defunct.', 'It is against this background that Magadh Jal Jamaat scripted a unique success story when they revived the Saryu talaab in 2006 and later on the Jamune Dasain in Gaya city with the help of Army Service Corps Gaya, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), police officials, professors, students, doctors and farmers. The revival of this pond set in motion a surge of constructive forces in the region and soon the effects ping-ponged into the revival of ahar pynes. Around seventeen panchayats benefited from the revival of the 28 km long Chapardha pyne, which carries greater discharge than the Son canal, the main public irrigation system in the area.', '“Apna Pani – Apni Pahal” – A film on Magadh Jal Jamaat’s work on reviving the ahar pyne systems in Gaya, Bihar – Part II', 'Attempts have been made to privatise the traditional irrigation systems during the period 1997-2008 and the Magadh Jal Jamaat has been creating awareness about the consequences of this and the need to successfully restore the systems on a collective basis. While the state has been creating grounds for bringing in new policy and legal framework, the group has formulated a Water Policy for the Magadh region based on wide consultations.', 'Magadh Jal Jamaat came up with a booklet titled “Gaya shahar ki jal vyavastha: Samasya evam samadhan”, (Water Management in the city of Gaya: Problem and Solution) which attempts to deepen the understanding of the city’s physiography, hydro-geology, present status of water availability, its potential and based on these suggests water management measures that should be taken. It notes that the city when compared to places in Punjab and Gujarat is better endowed in terms of water availability but has highly inadequate water storage and distribution mechanism. The crisis according to Ravindra Pathak, Magadh Jal Jamaat is man-made and the problem has been plaguing the city in the drought years of 2006 and 2010.', 'While the State Government had rights over the water, the Bihar Irrigation Act of 1997 delegated the Collector with the authority to engage any agency to repair or construct the water systems whenever it is unable to do so on its own and this is one point which MJJ has utilised. In this locale, where agriculture is increasingly becoming unviable and irrigation costly, MJJ has created a momentum by focusing on smaller barrages on streams and calling for renovation of the system through regular removal of sand through reviving collective means like the traditional system of ‘gomam’ (community labour), which had till some time ago seemed to have been washed away with the top soil.', 'They are actively working in close collaboration with the State Government to facilitate the creation of community based organizations for undertaking large-scale ahar-pyne renovation programme in the area.

Whether through love for his country or love for his fellow human beings, Sudhanshu Biswas teaches the values of compassion, perseverance and belief in one’s purpose.', '(Update: The 99-year-old freedom fighter from West Bengal has been honoured with the Padma Shri award for the year 2018. His philantrophic organisation runs schools, orphanages and dispensaries for the poor and the downtrodden.).', 'Getting down from a crowded local train at Dakshin Durgapur railway station, I saw dark clouds setting in. I came out of the station and searched for a rickshaw or cycle-van (a popular mode of transport in rural India). Finding none, I began walking through the village roads. I am in a village of South 24 Paragans district, 35 kms from Kolkata. This district and the neighbouring Sunderbans are some of the poorest districts of India. After walking 2kms in the mild rain, I reached ‘Sri Ramakrisha Sevashram’ (SRKS) to meet Mr. Sudhanshu Biswas.', 'Owing to urbanization, old people get deserted by their family. The hermitage provides shelter to 29 senior citizens from the nearby villages. A charitable dispensary is also run as a part SRKS. To top it all, well into his seventies, Mr. Biswas studied general medicine and Homeopathy, observing the irregularities of doctors in villages. He collects medicine samples from physicians and distributes them among the sick.', 'Drying myself with a towel, I inquired why there was no transportation from the station. Mr. Biswas replied with a smile “When there is no demand, there is no supply”! His simple reply, or rather its inverse, also answered my unasked question as to why this 95 year old freedom fighter chose to spend his last four decades here. Instead I asked him what was the main objective of SRKS. ', 'His kindly eyes met mine directly and he said “To impart man-making education”. The depth of conviction came from his own first-hand experience of being arrested from the examination hall by the British police during his childhood; a memory that has driven him since to help educate the less privileged—backed by his understanding of the importance and meaning of education.', 'As the conversation went on I learnt that he had left home while still in his teens to fight for India’s freedom. He successfully carried ‘live bombs’ to lodge an attack on the British Administration. Mr. Biswas dodged death a number of times in gun battles. He was caught by the British and jailed for several years. The simple man before me has been a part of the famous revolutionary group – Anushilan Samity.', 'After independence, enthused by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda – “Service to man is service to God”, Mr. Biswas founded SRKS. No wonder he had chosen this poverty stricken village where I was surprised to see that neither any temple nor mosque existed – an unusual occurrence in India.', 'In the last four decades, he has set up 18 free schools for the poor children in remote villages in the nearby Sunderban area. The teachers of the schools belong to the same village and hence an ownership is created. Till date, thousands of orphans have stayed and studied in SRKS and currently he is bringing up 67 orphan students who study and take care of all the work of SRKS.', 'He sits straight, glows bright while talking about the past with deep eyes revealing his knowledge about ancient religious scriptures. He talks and hears well, as he showed me the ashram which has a pond, small agricultural tracks and fruit trees. Every day he takes Mathematics classes in the school. I truly believe now – “This life is short, the vanities of the world are transient, but they alone live who live for others, the rest are more dead than alive.”', 'I met a person who is superior to me in all aspects. Physique: At 95 he does more physical work than me. Work: A visionary and does more significant work than myself. Sacrifice: I sacrifice little money and few hours for the down-trodden, his entire life is for and among the poor. Love: I married my school mate after 10 years of courtship; he still carries the bullet marks he received due to his love for his own country and billion countrymen. Academics: He still teaches 10th class mathematics, without the help of calculator. Scripture knowledge: I have the holy thread around me and he has the ageless wisdom around himself.', 'A standard eighth student came to close the gate. Seeing the never ending rain and after enquiring that I have no umbrella with me, he thought for a while and opened his cap. His cap was an old free cap from a popular health drink provider. It was as prized for him as our premium branded watch or new i-pod is. He offered his cap and insisted that I wore this, to protect my head from the shower. I was indeed touched by his gestures. Mr. Biswas is right; I was taken aback with the man-making value education infused in these kids. Although it was raining, I saw the dark clouds flying by.', 'You could visit their website for more information on their work, and how you could help them in this. While monetary assistance is needed, even donations in kind are appreciated. Due to the poor access to the place, it is not easy to attract and retain primary teachers and mentors. Also, they are unable to offer very lucrative packages for good teachers to live there. To solve this, we are exploring the feasibility of holding virtual classes. This will be possible if we can manage to get desktops, webcams and internet connectivity.', 'In addition to this, stationery items, groceries, woolen clothes and blankets would be highly appreciated. When I visited them second time, during December it was a pity to see these kids in half pants!

Earlier in the week, you read about the courageous Preeti Monga and the fearless Sunitha Krishnan. We are also giving our readers a chance to grab a copy of the biography of one of the most resolute and awe-inspiring women of today – Aung San Suu Kyi in this giveaway. Today, we tell you the story of another adventurous woman, an IAF officer who has scaled many heights, including the daunting Mt. Everest!', '“It was truly a top-of-the-world feeling. Not a cloud in the sky, no obstruction between the horizon and me… Sitting on the platform I had made with my ice-axe, I had a clear, 360-degree view. I knew my life would change after that moment.”', 'Life did change. Flight Lieutenant Nivedita Choudhary became the first woman from the Indian Air Force (IAF) to summit the Mt. Everest – and the first woman from Rajasthan to achieve this feat. In fact, she was feted by the state chief minister for her rare achievement. “The one hour I spent on world’s highest point etched my name in history. It will always be the best moment of my life,” she says with a smile.', 'It was in October 2009 that Choudhary, an IAF officer who had just joined the squadron in Agra, chanced upon a broadcast calling for volunteers for IAF’s women expedition to the Everest. She volunteered for the extreme adventure activity “just like that” — without realising that, three years later, she would do what no woman in the air force had ever done. The other women Everest summiteers on her team, Squadron Leader Nirupama Pandey and Flight Lieutenant Rajika Sharma, climbed the peak five days later.', 'Of course, these are not the only firsts to Choudhary’s name. Just a year earlier, she had been the first and only IAF officer to date to scale the 7,557-metre Mt. Kamet, India’s highest climbing peak. Recalls the 27-year-old, who went to a government girls’ school in Jaipur,', 'Kamet was more eventful than Everest. The weather was very bad. There were no ropes and the route was full of hidden crevasses. Half way, we considered aborting the attempt. I had an Army ‘jawan’ (soldier) and an airman with me. As the senior-most in the team, I had to take a call. We could have been lost in the snow or have fallen into a crevasse since we couldn’t see a thing. But I thought, let’s do it. I was thinking a successful ascent would erase the memories of the previous attempt in 2005 when the IAF team had been caught in severely turbulent conditions and had to be rescued. I am happy I took the risk.', 'On the descent, though, the mountaineers did meet up with a rescue team looking out for them with high-intensity lights and whistles.', 'For Choudhary, the Kamet expedition was a precursor to the Everest mission. Incidentally, it was the third expedition for the IAF women mountaineering team after Mt. Stok Kangri (6,153 metres) in August 2010 and Mt. Bhagirathi-II (6,512 metres) in September-October 2009. Before she started off on her mountaineering trips Choudhary had undergone a month-long training in basic mountaineering in Darjeeling in November 2009 and it was on the basis of her performance there that she had made the cut for the Everest expedition. The Everest expedition was flagged off a day after she turned 26 on April 13, 2011. Thirty-seven days later, she was literally on top of the world.', 'The youngest woman on the team — comprising eight women officers, one medical officer and eight male soldiers — Choudhary gives a blow-by-blow account of the attempt. “We were at south col on May 20. The weather was initially bad, with wind speeds of 40-50 knots. Our team leader, Group Captain Dahiya, was in two minds. We started walking from the summit camp (8,000 metres) at 10 p.m. after the wind calmed a little. My Sherpa didn’t take oxygen. After two hours, his body gave up. I looked back and there was no one behind me. My spare oxygen bottle was also with him,” she recalls.', 'Undeterred, she decided to trace her way back a little and look for him. It was only after an hour of descend that Choudhary found him. “I gave him oxygen and waited another hour before the two of us began our ascent. At 3 a.m., I was at the balcony, the only place where climbers can stand straight — otherwise it’s all inclines of 60-70 degrees. Finally, at 8 a.m., I had conquered the world’s highest mountain peak,” she says.', 'Corporal Raju Sindhu summited an hour later. Squadron Leader Nirupama Pandey and Flight Lieutenant Rajika Sharma along with Squadron Leader D. Panda, Sergeant Jasbir Singh and Corporal Ganesh Pokhariyal, triumphed five days later. The entire IAF team, which had followed the southeast ridge route — Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay had used this route in 1953 during the first Everest ascent — despite facing technical challenges thrown up by the extremely volatile Khumbu icefall, had successfully put seven climbers on the Everest.', 'Choudhary, today, is a firm believer that women make successful mountaineers, “I would say, it’s easier for women (to scale such heights). It’s more a mind game than entailing physical strength, and women are always mentally more stable and can take more stress than men.”', 'Mountaineering, however, was never her first love; it was the skies that had captured her imagination. Although she had completed her Bachelor’s degree in Technology from Jaipur’s Arya Engineering College, engineering was always her second option when it came to a career. Her heart was set on being an officer in the Air Force.', 'I was in the NCC Air Wing in college and I got a chance to fly a little bit. It entailed just one or two sorties in a Super Dimona aircraft, but I decided I wanted to be in the Indian Air Force.', 'Choudhary appeared for the Service Selection Board (SSB) examinations in the final year of engineering and got selected. Today, she is a navigator in the transport fleet and flies the A-32 aircraft. In her never ending list of firsts is also the fact that she is the first person from her family to join the defence forces. Her father, Prabhakar Singh Choudhary, 53, was a farmer in Mukundgarh village, in the Nawalgarh tehsil of Jhunjhunu district, before he shifted to the state capital in order to ensure that his three children – two daughters and a son – had access to better education and employment opportunities. The family led a humble existence, living in a modest home, and since her father couldn’t afford expensive private education, the two girls, Nivedita and her younger sister, Deepika, went to the Gandhi Nagar Government Girls’ School.', 'An inspired Deepika, who also completed her engineering from Jaipur, has followed in her sister’s footsteps. She worked with Engineers India Limited for a year before getting commissioned in the Indian Navy in 2011. “Deepika had watched me and was very impressed by the disciplined, safe and respectful environment for girls in the defence forces,” explains her proud older sibling.', 'The next project Choudhary has set for herself is to climb all 14 eight-thousanders – peaks that are more than 8,000 metres high. So far, only two women – 38-year-old Basque Spanish Edurne Pasaban Lizarribar and 41-year-old Austrian Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner – have done this, and it’s no mean task. Pasaban, in fact, completed this feat in May 2010, nine years after she climbed her first 8,000 peak, the Everest.', 'Choudhary isn’t sure if she can summit all 14 peaks as an IAF officer before she retires at 35.

As I read and understood what Dr. Sunitha Krishnan has done and continues to do, I was filled with admiration and respect for her.', 'A victim of gang rape herself, Sunitha Krishnan has risen from the ashes to rescue others from trafficking. The tasks she has on hand are just too enormous. Her organization has been instrumental in rescuing and rehabilitating thousands of women and children.', 'She has a blog titled “Sunitha Krishnan: Anti-Trafficking Crusader” where she recounts her experiences of rescue. Actually, her blog is not an easy read. It is very difficult to read about small girls (as young as four year old) being raped by fathers, uncles, brothers, cousins and neighbours. Her blog posts can just shame us all out of our peaceful existence. The least we can do is spread awareness about the scourge of trafficking.', 'We are a very proud nation, boasting of our glorious past and our current status of being an ‘economic giant’. But we seem to brush under the carpet the sins committed by us. Trafficking is increasing at an alarming rate and no one is spared. Girls are brought in from Nepal and sold to brothels all across our nation. The alarming part is that people who are involved in all this are the ones who are trusted by victims.', 'The condition of the victims is worse than that of slaves! The victims are subjected to the worst form of sexual abuse often accompanied by violence. It leaves the victims emotionally as also physically brutalised. The victims have to keep catering to many clients and end up with HIV/AIDS. Then, they are just discarded as they are now useless and cannot bring in any returns for their owners.', 'Sunitha’s organization ‘Prajwala’ has been rehabilitating the victims after rescuing them. Shelters have been built and a factory has been opened where skills like carpentry, welding, etc. are taught to the girls. Prajwala also tries to unite the victims with their families. Sometimes, the victims are not accepted back by the families owing to the backwardness of our views on women. At such times, Prajwala takes full responsibility of these victims. Some women and girls are also married off by Prajwala in its endeavour to integrate the victims back into society. Prajwala also takes care of the last rites of the victims who pass away. In all these tasks, Prajwala faces stiff opposition from our society.', 'Prajwala works with police and other law enforcement agencies in this job of fighting commercial sexual expolitation. The organization never seeks publicity for the rescue of the girls, letting its work speak for itself.', 'Prajwala and Sunitha have won many awards for their exemplary work. They are now sought after the world over by programs for rescue and rehabilitation of victims of trafficking. Even State governments are listening to Prajwala and Sunitha in effecting measures for the prevention of trafficking. All this will surely help in minimising this crime.', 'Sunitha has said time and again that the silence of the society towards human trafficking has to change.

In a country like India, it is sometimes all the more demanding due to societal attitudes and lack of access. Preeti Monga has been visually impaired since age six. Here she recounts, in her own words, the challenges she has had to face and the courage she found to not only overcome them, but also start an organization to help persons with disability. Truly, an inspiring woman.', 'It is more than two decades ago that I first heard people referring to me as a positive person. At that point, I remember, I was feverishly struggling with life and even mustering up a smile was personal torture. Yet, if I could still smile, it was because of my parents.', 'I am 53 today. My visual disability was discovered at the age of about six, after constant complaints about my school work from teachers. I was instantly rushed to our family doctor who diagnosed my approaching blindness. It must have been a shattering experience for my parents but they kept it away from me. The atmosphere at home was normal and brimming with love and happiness. I was singularly free of anxieties and the fear of disaster did not destroy my confidence in any way.', 'Stationed in the remote township of Agartala, the capital of the northeast state of Tripura, and with little access to specialised support, counselling or guidance, my parents had absolutely no idea about how to bring up a blind child. All they did was to rely on their own good sense. For a while, they toyed with the idea of sending me to a school for the blind, but none of the schools they visited satisfied them and they fortunately abandoned that option. Instead, following their instincts, my parents brought me up just as they did before the disability came to mark my life. They taught me everything they needed to, in ways that were innovative and simple. For instance, my mother would close her own eyes and develop effective ways to teach me.', 'I was lucky, therefore, to be among the few disabled people who had a family that did not waste time in finding ways to get me to accept my disability and make the most of the other positives I possessed. It was because of close family members that I could journey through life without having to face segregation and rejection alone.', 'This, of course, does not mean that it was smooth sailing all the way. Challenges became part of my life. The first major setback came when I was thrown out of school at the end of Class VIII on the argument that because I was blind I was a source of disturbance for the other students. My formal education came to a standstill since no other regular school wanted to admit me, despite the best efforts of my parents. Blind schools were the only other option. But because their standards were so low they were not a viable option.', 'Without formal schooling, what were the choices before me? I was sent to learn music since it was said that if one loses one’s sight, one is automatically bestowed with the gift of being musical! For the next eight years I leant the sitar and completed a diploma from the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya. Unfortunately, I never understood music sufficiently and failed completely at it.', 'By this time I had grown up into a young woman with all the dreams that youth brings with it. Like women of my age, I too wanted a good marriage, kids and a reasonably comfortable home. But it seemed the world had other ideas. Because I was blind I had no right, it seems, to hold on to the simple, down-to-earth aspirations of human beings everywhere.', 'That lesson was brought home when the hunt for a husband began. I had a host of men who were friends but no one wanted to marry me. An arranged marriage seemed out of the question. Suitors would arrive and back off the moment they found that I had vision impairment.', 'That was a period of pain and humiliation in my life. Finally, in 1982, I met and married my first husband. But it was a marriage that headed straight for the rocks from the very beginning. By 1986 – I was a mother of two then – I knew I had to do something to get the children and myself out of the mess we were in. But this meant that I had to first become economically independent. With only a Class 10 certificate by way of educational qualifications to my name, it seemed that chances of getting a job were very slim indeed. The only skills I possessed were those of being a good homemaker and a reasonably good typist with some very basic knowledge of music. It took me a whole year to figure out a way to earn for myself. I then struck upon the idea of becoming an Aerobics instructor. Within six months, I had my own classes running smoothly.', 'In 1993, I finally separated from my first husband. The children and I moved back into my parents’ home where I was once again unconditionally supported by my parents as well as brother and sister-in-law. In 1994, I took up a full time job at the National Association for the Blind as a resource person and a computer teacher. From there I moved on to getting a job as a marketing and sales manager with a food marketing company. It was here that I met my second husband. Although he was almost ten years younger to me, I knew he was just the person I was searching for all these years. In the year 2000, I joined Dr Shroff’s Charity Eye Hospital, Daryaganj, as head of public relations and slowly began to get drawn into training, counselling and patient care.', 'Looking back I realise that years of struggle and repeated failures left me with a profound sense of fearlessness. Garnering the strength to hang on, no matter what the situation, was my recipe for success. I felt that the time had now come to share this valuable insight with others and that led me to launch a non-profit called Silver Linings Trust. It sets out to motivate, inspire, train, guide and counsel people with disability in order to empower them to merge with the mainstream and help them lead fulfilled, meaningful lives.', 'The road of life has been long and tortuous one, but finally today I have a sense of peace.

Mohan Foundation has been promoting organ donation since 1997, and helps people understand what it entails – the rewards, the fears and the process. In the end, you could be gifting life to not one but several beneficiaries.', 'I recall when I lost my maternal grandmother within seconds the home got enveloped into a silence of a different kind. We just held on to each other and stood still. A few moments later my uncle broke the silence. He made a phone call and smiled at us. It left me bemused but the faint smile was infectious. My mother and aunt too smiled a bit. An hour later two unknown adults walked into our home and when they left they looked at us, the grandchildren, and said, “It is your day to feel both extremely sad and proud.”', 'She had pledged donation of her eyes. That’s how I first learnt about organ donation – the goodness of it. A few months later we lost our maternal grandfather too. He too left behind the gift of sight. Soon after I started reading about the facts behind organ donation to know what it takes to be a donor.', 'So recently when I got a chance to speak to the team at Mohan Foundation, Chennai I felt grateful for the chance to learn more, take pride in my grandparents and spread awareness on the cause that saves lives.', 'Mohan Foundation is a not-for-profit and non-governmental organisation that has been promoting organ donation since 1997 and is led under the inspirational leadership of Dr. Sunil Shroff. Their team of medical and non-medical professionals is devoted to increasing the reach of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, which was passed by the GOI in 1994 to broaden the concept of organ donation and stop commercial dealings in organs. In my interaction with the team I learn that one can now donate not only one’s eyes but also other vital organs like the heart, lungs, liver, pancreas and kidneys. Over to their team.', 'Organ donation is removal of viable organs from a donor (brain dead individual) and transplanting them to a recipient. Solid organs like heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas and intestine can be donated. Other tissues like corneas (eyes), skin, bones, cartilages, etc. can also be donated.', 'However, one needs to note that one can donate solid organs only in case of brain death, “In case of natural death or cardiac death only eyes and other tissues can be donated.”', 'Mohan Foundation has been the pioneer in the Deceased Donation Program in the country. From a single office in Chennai with 20-25 donations per year, the Foundation now does close 150-170 donations each year translating up to 800-900 organs. However, in the absence of a defined government program, the program has not gained the desired momentum.', 'While the awareness levels have risen in cities where the Foundation has a presence and does intensive awareness programs, there are pockets that remain completely unaware and no donations are taking place there. Also unlike a few metros, most cities do not have transplant facilities and therefore no efforts at organ donation either. We do have a long way to go.', 'No doubt the journey has been a hard one but they feel it has its own share of enriching rewards,', 'The biggest and the most satisfying reward for this work is that you are ultimately saving lives. Many patients with end stage organ failure requiring transplants actually die waiting for an organ. The gift of an organ gives not only the individual but entire families, a new lease on life.', 'It is a difficult field of work more so in the absence of a strong government will towards this area. Health being a state subject, a few state governments have invested in this program (like Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh to name a few) while the others have shown very little or no interest – this is why the donation rates in our country remain so low and the program is lop-sided. In addition, unlike the western world, there is very little organised funding for this work. It is a challenge to raise funds to upscale the work and the organisation is largely dependent of philanthropy of individuals and corporate houses and funds raised through events.', 'So in this situation the onus of lending a lease of life lies on each one of us. So how does one register for organ donation and ensure that the needful is done in case of loss of life?', 'One can pledge for organ donation by signing on a donor card (it could be of an NGO like ours or a hospital). A donor card is not a legal document. It is an expression of one’s will to be a donor. What is more important is to let your family members know about your wish as in our country the family’s decision is considered final.', 'Needless to say organ donation comes with its shares of doubts, consensus and fears.', 'The key reasons that we come across are religious biases or fear of mutilating the body further in case it has undergone multiple injuries. At times it is also the lack of consensus amongst all family members that prevents them from donating the organs of their loved one. Hence we emphasize on the fact that once anybody has pledged his/her organs it is important to let all the family members know of your wish.
