We were there and here are some of the updates of that day.', 'The event started off with a panel discussion on “Opportunities and Challenges for financial inclusion in India”. The panelists were  Dr. Tara Thiagarajan (Madura Microfinance), Brij Mohan ( ACCESS Development Services), Ramesh Ramanathan (Janalakshmi), Geeta Goel (Dell Foundation), Rwituja Gomes Mookherjee (British Council), Ganesh Rangaswamy (Lok Capital) and Rahul Bedi (Intel South Asia).', 'The definition of social entrepreneurship was an important one, with some of the panelists defining it as any entrepreneurial idea being conceptualized/executed with a social intent. The important aspect of this definition was also the fact that a social entrepreneur need not be one with a non-profit mindset.', 'Much to my personal disappointment, the focus was largely on the subject of microfinance. However, I guess this ‘financial inclusion’ definition is still evolving and perhaps microfinance is the only tool out there currently.', 'Rather than focussing on these microfinance-based discussions, I would like to highlight some interesting learnings for potential social entrepreneurs out there. Rahul of Intel summarized 3 key things that one needs to consider to scale and sustain in the social space:', 'Brij Mohan too emphasised that getting your social intent right was the most important step. After establishing your social intent, you can then shift gears to apply business skills in taking your social idea forward.', 'Dr. Tara brought out an important point that most organizations on the scaling phase tend to face – losing the sight of your idea’s original intent. She said that a social entrepreneur should always focus on the value system of her/his organization.', 'Ramesh Ramanathan, who is a wonderful speaker, stated categorically that he really had no advise to give. He asked entrepreneurs to get real about expectations, citing the statistic that 90% of all new initiatives fail. But, entrepreneurs need to be relentless in their pursuit – that is important, he stated.\nAs part of his long and illustrious stint in this space, Ramesh has some valuable experience and he pointed out the two main challenges that one faces when working in a social space:', 'These bits of information were very useful for the many social entrepreneurs who had gathered at the event. The second half of the day was dedicated to an exciting session of 17 entrepreneurs who showcased their social ideas to the audience. We will write about these ideas in the forthcoming articles.

2,2010-11,"['Written by Unnati Narang', 'Protecting your ‘Right to Walk’']","['\n\n\nby\n\nUnnati Narang\n\n\nNovember 22, 2010, 7:39 am \n\n\n', 'Are you busy fighting for your rights to freedom of speech, free expression or religious practices? Do you try protecting your liberties against encroachment by others? While struggling with these seemingly bigger issues, you may tend to overlook the very basic rights needed in everyday living. These are things like waking up in the morning and going out for a walk, or getting off the bus in the evening and walking home. With less and less of it, walking seems to have become passé, gone with the ‘shimmer’ of dancing headlights and the ‘music’ of honking four wheels especially in cities. Is there is no argument in support of walking nowadays? Who would like to walk on filthy roads or narrow pavements that call for an acrobat’s balancing skills to avoid crashing in front of moving vehicles? Walking has truly become a nightmare. While most of us complain and curse the systems, there are some who actually raise a voice and try to change things, rather than accepting them the way they are. The Right to Walk Foundation, the brainchild of Ms. Kanthimathi Kannan, is one of them.', 'Ms Kannan, a resident of the city of Hyderabad, moved by the sight of pedestrians of the city walking either on the road, at the risk of being run-over by vehicles or on garbage-filled pavements or on pavements that doubled up as public urinals, decided to start a campaign to goad the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and the Police to take up the matter of pedestrian problems seriously and to do something to improve the condition of pavements around the city and make them pedestrian-friendly. The movement started by identifying the most common problems faced by pedestrians. Kannan felt that the failure to provide the common man with a wide enough footpath, free of encroachments, stench and garbage to walk on was the major challenge at hand.', 'In early 2007, she quit her job and decided to work on this movement fulltime. Kannan explains, “The idea of quitting my work was not very sudden and it was very well thought through. After about 20 years outside the city of Hyderabad, when I got back to my city in 2002 I found that it was very difficult to walk. I tried complaining to the Municipal Corporation in January 2005 on a call centre line. The call centre line only registered the complaints but did not do any follow up and to my dismay there was no change in the area that I had described in my compliant. \xa0Later I petitioned the municipal authorities with a written complaint twice but with work piling up it was not possible to devote more time to the issue. \xa0The thought of quitting my job and doing this on a full time basis occurred to me around the early part of 2007. As a student, I used to walk from my home to Mehdipatnam and take a bus to my college but I found that to my utter shock that young college girls from my locality use an auto to go and are picked up by an auto for coming back too. This and other similar instances compelled me to rethink about the issue and devote myself to a full time activist role.”', 'The right to walk should come as naturally to humans as the right to breathe or live. Yet, most of us often forget and take for granted the problems we face as pedestrians. What made Kannan notice these? She adds, “This critical issue has been neglected and even now continues to be neglected and has not found centre stage in the civic issues. Probably the very fact that car ownership implies ‘bade log’ might also have contributed to making walking a neglected issue. Whenever we interview people struggling to cross the road, we have found that they feel that they need to struggle because they are poor and do not have a vehicle. In the words of an officer – All of us look at walking as a start to life and try to graduate into a motor bike and later to a car and never look back at the need to walk.”', 'While the nascent steps have been taken, a movement like this takes a long while before sconsiderable impact can be made. While the foundation has been able to make the authorities understand the issue, as of now it has been unable to get them to take action. The founder explains, “We have been successful in filing the Human Rights petition and getting the commission to acknowledge that obstacles for walking are a Human Right violation. We have a long way to go and as I often describe it, we have a marathon to run and we have probably run the first meter.”', 'Support the Right to Walk Foundation cover the rest of the miles\xa0in the following ways:', 'For more, visit www[dot]right2walk[dot]com (Update: Removed the hyperlink to this site after a few readers complained of the link not working correctly).\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', ""Co-Founder of Serene Woods portal for authors and photographers, I have authored two books - 'Drenched Soul' (poetry) and 'If At All' (fiction).

The rural counterparts though lag reasonably behind. However, the fact that around 30% of the wireless subscriber base of most operators reside in rural areas points to a welcoming trend. If penetration of rural telephony can further be improved, considerable socio-economic benefits will be reaped.', 'One such attempt to tap the opportunity in rural India and use mobile services as an extension of developmental efforts is the Gaon Ki Awaaz or Village Voice rural news bulletin. Launched in December 2009 by the International Media Institute of India, Noida, it uses the mobile phone as a broadcast tool.', 'Gaon Ki Awaaz is about empowering the rural masses through information dissemination. News alerts are transmitted twice a day to villagers living in and around the Rampur-Mathura village of Uttar Pradesh, located 76 Km from Lucknow as voice messages, on their phones. What started with only 25 villagers, reached a base of 250 in the first six months.', 'The initiative is a founding of Sunil Saxena, the Dean of the International Media Institute of India, and Satyendra Pratap, a former journalist from Rampur. Discussing his beginnings and the journey so far, Mr Saxena explains, “I stated working with mobile phones back in 2001. I had also previously worked with a newspaper house, as a print journalist. We had experimented with sms news alerts in the urban areas but when mobile phone penetration started in rural India, more and more villages had mobile phone access, hence I started looking at the possibility of carrying information about them, by them and in their language. Indian media is largely urban centric. While there is an explosion of information in the urban setting, rural areas mostly remain an information silence zone. The tremendous scope of information in improving rural lifestyles and educating villagers about government schemes for their benefits motivated us to start Gaon Ki Awaaz. Voice mail works best for communities that cannot read newspapers because they are illiterate or watch news on TV because of lack of electricity”\n\nApart from information sharing, the services are also used for rural advertising, complaints against social abuses, human rights issues, etc. The two local reporters who generate the news bulletins are Divyakar Pratap Singh, who teaches at the Rani Saraswati Shishu Mandir located in the village, and Priya Gupta, who studies in the same school. The local filter for the audio bulletins is Satyendra Pratap, who grew up in the village and is now the village head. He scans the content for accuracy and usefulness before passing it to the news desk in Noida for onward transmission. In Noida, the recordings in MMS form are converted into Wav format. They have tied up with Netxcell Ltd, an IT company in Hyderabad that uses Mobile Internet Platform (MIP) to broadcast these as voice calls.', 'The project empowers villagers at every level because news is generated for them by themselves. What’s more! Broadcasting is also in their own language Avadhi. Initially launched as a free service, subscribers are now charged a mere ten rupees per month for it.', 'The Gaon Ki Awaaz news service was conferred the mBillionth South Asia 2010 Award in the m-News and Journalism Category on July 23 for innovation in the field of mobile content that benefited the masses.', 'Mr. Saxena, details his plans for the future of the venture, “Two years ago I moved to Delhi as I wanted to develop a rural medium where mobile phones could be used. Now, we wish to scale up this social venture and take it to more villages, as a self-sustainable model. The first challenge is to raise initial funding. Currently we are supported by the Knight Foundation. For the model to be sustainable in future, to scale it up and reach millions of people, we will need growth capital. Another challenge is continuous information validation. We are very careful about it and will be having a responsible Editor for groups of villages.”', 'It is highly recommended that you listen to the various news bulletins and campaigns directly!

It is no surprise thus that on an average more than one in three students drop out of primary school before the fifth standard.', 'The effort required to overhaul the primary education system in the country seems Herculean, and would require a large input of time and resources.

During the two-years, Fellows gain important knowledge and experience of India’s educational system and its challenges, which enables them to provide solutions to problems faced within their classrooms and school communities.', 'Teach For India Fellows are a diverse set- some coming after years of experience in industries ranging from investment banking to mining while others enthusiastic and fresh out of college. All of them share 2 basic qualities- a proven ability to lead and to overcome challenging and resource-constrained environments. To add to this is a common vision they believe in- that every child deserves an excellent education.', 'A 5-week Training Institute is organized to prepare the Fellows for teaching in school. It is innovative, rigorous and tries to push every Fellow far beyond his comfort zone. On the first day of training, Fellows are dropped off into a community for 2 hours and told to connect with a child. Fellows undergo 4 weeks on-the-job training by teaching in summer school. By the time Institute is over, they are ready for school.', 'Post the Teach For India Fellowship, Teach For India Fellows will work from within and across different sectors to advocate equity in education. This may be through involvement in corporate foundations to encourage funding, through working in the government to influence policies towards education equity or through working in other social organizations involved in getting better education for the underprivileged.', 'Through their efforts, they will ensure that one day, every child in India attains an excellent education.', 'Apply for the 2011 Teach For India Fellowship on http://www.teachforindia.org/apply-now.php\n', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

I decided to visit them as they work for a cause close to my heart – microfinance and entrepreneurship development. It is incredible how a little amount of ‘seed funding’ can do a lot of good to the way people live their lives and what they do with the opportunities that come their way. In fact, as I discovered, financial assistance could even enable people to create new opportunities. Sita Devi Foundation, is dedicated to serve the needs of the poor through disbursal of small loans and other endeavours such as mobilizing the community, supporting community based entrepreneurial programmes , etc.', 'In the heart of Delhi, Paharganj, I discovered a world where things were not as easy as they seemed on the outside. I walked on perfectly clean, moderately crowded, mundane city streets of Delhi to reach the office of Sita Devi. From there, I was led to much less cleaner, extremely crowded for their size and buzzing with activity streets surrounded by small brick houses on both sides. Women could be seeing washing dishes, washing clothes, sewing garments or simply chit chatting. Suddenly, from a Delhi of high rise buildings, I seemed to have reached a much humbler setting where life was defined by the everyday chores and responsibilities. I also discovered how poverty could be challenged, only with a little bit of courage and a million shining stars called dreams; dreams nurtured by NGOs such as Sita Devi Foundation.\n', 'They say money attracts money. You definitely can’t create money out of thin air. Those who are caught up in the vicious cycle of poverty have very little to start with. To break free from this cycle, external help is required.  In a nation such as ours, the rich can’t turn their backs or shut their eyes. Every person has to do it.', 'In the slums of adjoining areas in Paharganj, I met Savitri, a forty year old woman with a family of seven. She explains that her children are studying and that she helps her husband, a vegetable vendor. I ask my questions quickly, knowing she has household chores to do.', 'Noticing, she explains, “Today I don’t have to work. It’s a national holiday.” Of course, October 2nd! But that doesn’t relieve her of the washing and cleaning at home. The family’s economic troubles sourced from not having enough money to buy vegetables from the ‘mandi’ for selling during the day.\nNo money. No stock. Not enough sales. Not enough money. No savings.\nSavitri’s family was stuck in this vicious cycle and could not escape poverty. What helped them? “Our problems ceased when I became part of the Amar group of SDF. They gave us small loans, which we used to buy more vegetables. Soon we could start saving much more and could send our children to schools,” she explains.', 'There are many others like Savitri who have found opportunities to grow in their trades because of these token loans.\nRamkumar, a cobbler, with a small stall in one of the street corners can’t be happier. I ask him what brings a smile to his face and he narrates without hesitation, “I come from Raibareilly. I have 6 children out of which 4 are studying. Due to some health problems, I had to close down my stall for many months. When I came back, I found that the shop had been run down; I did not have the necessary equipment to start all over again. It was then that I joined Neeraj group of SDF and availed their loan facility twice. Using the loan amount, I have been able to increase my income by about Rs. 1,500 per month!”', 'Leader of the Neeraj Group Radhakrishna has a similar story to tell. With loan assistance, he is able to stock a larger variety at his snack shop, thus earning about Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 3000 more per month.\nWhat do these figures translate into?

Sounds perfect! But is it, really? How is the change happening at the grassroots? Rakhi Singh Vidaya, Director of Sita Devi Foundation and her husband started the foundation back in 2002 with a view to give back to the society. They started as a charitable movement to support school going, underprivileged children in terms of contributing school bags, stationery, necessary food items, etc.', 'Soon, they felt an urge to formalize the movement and give it a new meaning. Identifying livelihood as a major area of concern for the family unit, they decided to experiment with the microfinance model in their area and added to their Board, a host of accomplished persons.', '“In the initial days, we had simple criteria of forming joint liability groups (JLG) for giving out loans: Below 55 years of age, most members should be in the same trade, should live close to each other, and should not be blood relatives. We formed the first group in Anand Parbad area..  The motto of JLG was to convert members to individual entrepreneurs,” explain the directors. With the expansion and growth of Microfinance, the society has been able to form 60 groups so far. In their upcoming plans, they hope to establish many more self-help groups for women.

The gender composition in India has worsened over time. Demographically, though the ratio has increased from 927 females per 1000 males to 933 from census of 1991 to 2001, this ratio is rapidly decreasing among children in the age group of 0-6.', 'Kolhapur District, Maharashtra has a ratio of 839 females per 1000 males, alarmingly low even by the national standards. The District Administration of Kolhapur sprung into action and started an innovative initiative called\xa0 “SAVE THE BABY GIRL” or STBG for short.', 'Selective abortion has been in existence ever since gender-identification has become possible through  ultrasound technology. The birth of an estimated 10 million girls may have been prevented by selective abortion in the past 20 years.', 'Sex determination of a foetus is today possible with the sonography machine. So STBG developed a monitoring solution for medical centres having sonography machines. Every centre is provided with a secure login using which they can submit the relevant information in accordance with the standard formats prescribed by the administration.', 'But there was a lacuna in the solution: the centres may not enter the patient record and subsequently perform an illegal abortion. To counteract this problem, STBG introduced a device called The Silent Observer. This device is connected to the VGA port (essentially a communication medium) which resides in between the sonography machine and the monitor.', 'This technological device captures the output stream from the various equipment including PCs, projectors, medical equipment etc. \xa0The captured data can then be broadcasted over the web or archived for later viewing. What this means: the exact view which was seen by the technician performing the sonography is captured and can be used for later viewing. ', 'Save the Baby Girl results in fool-proof tracking of the foetus thereby providing support, care and economic security to the pregnant woman. A wonderful way of using technology to solve a social problem!', 'For more information check out: www.savethebabygirl.com\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', 'Writer, Researcher interested in social enterprise, innovation, culture and networks.
