There’s more to him and Ambarnath. Quite disturbed with the rapid speed at which trees at his native were disappearing, Hari decided to do something.', 'In 2009 March, Hari started planting trees in Ambarnath. Hari wanted to do something concrete and this was it! And it was not just a dozen of trees that he planted; it was a dozen multiplied by ten. “I could eventually plan about 120 and most of them are taller than me today!” smiles Hari. He, in association with The Rotaract Club of Ambarnath, went on to do a street play outside Ambarnath railway station called “Nature baba ko gussa kyon aata hai,” which gathered about 400 people to stop and watch.', 'Hari soon moved to Mumbai but his ambition did not wane. Besides increasing the number of trees, he also wanted everyone to know the importance of having more trees around and what better way than educating students about it! This is when Hari thought of taking this up as a personal project. “I was discussing the objectives with my friends and that’s how the name Project 35 Trees came up. We have twenty eight states and seven union territories in India which sums up to thirty five and hence Project 35 Trees. The objective is to reach each state and union territory and spread the word. Moreover, the number 35 does not click with everybody which serves a purpose of the name being intriguing!” narrates Hari.', 'Hari’s friend Ryan suggested that he document whatever he did, and put him in touch with Anthony Karbhari (24), who is a freelance film-maker. So it was in October 2011 when the weekend trips began. Gujarat, Daman and Hyderabad were the first locations that Hari and Anthony tapped in the months to come. While Hari planted saplings, Anthony filmed all of this. Their plan was to go live with a family, eat with them and plant with them. They could have planted at any place, but they wanted someone to look after the saplings and therefore the plan of staying with families.', 'When Project 35 Trees took off, the plan of action included talking to students and educating them about the need for preserving forests and planting more trees. “It was Anthony and Anish who encouraged me to make this large. After almost a year, it was now time to do justice to number 35!” laughs Hari.', '“Our plan was to go to every state, interact with students, stay with families and plant with them. I thought I would have to put down my papers at work, but then surprisingly, they allowed me to go on a four month leave. I couldn’t have asked for more!” says Hari.', 'There was a lot of ground work to be done. Anthony and Hari reached out to friends and friends of friends through mails and social media. They wrote to numerous institutions seeking permission to talk to students and plant saplings. “We began our journey in early October this year and started clockwise from Mumbai. So from west, we moved to the north and east; we’ll hit south soon and then conclude in Mumbai,” informs Hari.', 'It is a little bit of a challenge to look for a host and to get an institution to say yes, but Hari says that it is all worth it. Any unforgettable experience?', 'We didn’t get any prior confirmation from schools or colleges in Agra. We were roaming around in Agra on Diwali in a rickshaw with saplings to plant. We didn’t want to waste a day. Since Diwali is a night phenomenon, we thought we’ll finish before it gets dark. We first went to an orphanage because where else can you find children on holidays?! They didn’t have the space for two trees. We then got rejected by a junior college and a church because who’s expecting random tree planting requests on Diwali day?! By this time the rickshaw walla turned to us and said, ‘Aapko kya chaahiye? Yahi na ki aap pedh lagao aur koi ussko sambhaalein? Phir toh aap mere yahaan lagao. Hum sambhaalenge!’ As someone who’s looking for people to trust saplings with, did we need any more reassurance? So we landed up planting two saplings at his place!', 'The duo is currently at Jamshedpur and is having the time of their life. But what about the budget and funds? While he was exploring options, Hari came across www.wishberry.in which is an online crowd-funding platform. The platform allows you to have an account for three months during which you can raise as much as money you want to. “With our weekend trips, we had an estimate of how much money we would require per city. So our budget for the entire tour is 5 Lacs plus a contingency fund. We have been able to collect about 1.45 lacs through the platform, and need a lot more!” Hari goes on to say.', '“Had the project got corporate back up, it would have been viewed differently. We’re not doing this for ourselves and wanted it to be a people’s project.” The duo talks to forest officials across all the locations and tries to understand the prime reason behind the diminishing green cover and the ever growing environmental problems. Once they’ve understood this and got their documentary made, it is then that they plan to collaborate with corporates to provide a solution for the same.', 'And yes! Hari and Anthony don’t travel alone. They travel with Changu Mangu – the miniature clay replicas of the duo. Project 35 Trees also has a facebook page through which they share their updates and reach out to people. “We have one more month to go and need more funds. Our three month package at www.wishberry.in is expiring in 3 days and we need more people to contribute,” appeals Hari.', 'Project 35 Trees has touched base with about 1200 students till now and this is just the beginning. They’ll be sending a copy of their documentary to all the institutions that they speak at.', 'If you wish to contribute to their cause you can log on to this page.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
1,2012-12,"['Archives', 'TBI Inspirations: Sonali Mukherjee Rises From The Ashes, Fights Violence Against Women']","['\n\n\nby\n\nKamayani Bali Mahabal\n\n\nDecember 21, 2012, 10:34 am \n\n\n', 'Sonali Mukherjee is a victim of a brutal acid attack that happened nine years ago. She and her family have had to suffer many hardships since then, with very little governmental and institutional support. In spite of this, the gritty youngster fought the system and demanded her rights, and is now an active voice for seeking justice in cases of sexual crimes against women.', 'As I went to meet Dhanbad-based Sonali Mukherjee, who was visiting Mumbai to be in special episode of ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’, various emotions raced through me. Then the door opened and a peppy voice broke through, “Didi aa jaye, aaj khana late ho gaya, aap bhi kha lo (I am having a late lunch, please join me).” I had heard about Sonali’s case. She had been subjected to an acid attack nine years ago when she was 17, but I had not expected this bright young woman who stood before me.', 'I smiled back and told her I will wait until she ate. As her father guided her into the room after lunch, I realised her eyesight loss was total. I hugged her before we began our conversation on the struggles of her life.', 'She started with an irony: It was her call for euthanasia that gave her a new lease of life. “Until July this year I was a victim. Now I am a survivor. My friends and family had abandoned me when I needed them most. But the media and people I didn’t even know came forward to help me live,” she said.', 'The Mumbai-based NGO, ‘Beti’, in association with the media group, Headlines Today, has raised Rs 30 lakh as part of Project Hope, which aims to give Sonali a new identity with the help of facial reconstruction. The 22 surgeries will be carried out at the B.L. Kapur Super Specialty Hospital in Rajendra Place, New Delhi.', 'Clad in a white salwar kameez with a colourful collar – white is a favourite hue – she wore goggles before getting photographed. “I don’t want the world to see me this way because I hope to be like any other woman soon,” she said referring to her impending surgeries. She added, ‘Yeh aadhi adhorri zindagi aadhe chehre ke saath nahi jeeni hai mujhey (I don’t want to live half a life, with half a face).”', 'She grew up in Dhanbad, Jharkhand. History and Hindi had enthused her as a school student and the freedom movement and Indian scriptures inspired her. “I loved being a National Cadet Core (NCC) recruit,” she remarked. College followed. She opted for sociology and planned to pursue a Ph.D, and go into academics. She also enjoyed films and was a big fan of Aishwarya Rai and Shahrukh Khan. “I saw all their movies – loved dancing to Aishwarya’s numbers.” She stopped here to poignantly remark that she hoped one day to re-gain her vision and watch films again.', 'Sonali, having experienced the horrific consequences of violence against women, had obviously thought deeply on the subject.', 'In India, women are advised to avoid sexual predators. But, think about it, society is directly responsible for the sexual harassment women face. Its patriarchal approach encourages men to ‘tease’ women, it’s seen as a ‘manly’ thing to do. In my case, we had complained to the parents about the behaviour of their children, but they did nothing.', 'She also referred to the epics, “Take the ‘Ramayana’. You have Rama denouncing his pregnant wife and ordering her to spend her life in exile even though she had accompanied him to the jungle to share in his afflictions. Why did Ram ‘rescue’ Sita if he was going to subject her to an ‘agnipariksha’ (trial by fire)?”', 'Rewinding to the dreadful night on April 22, 2003, she revealed that the family was sleeping on the open terrace of their home, “Around 2.30am I woke up with a sharp, burning sensation.” She felt her face, neck, right ear, the right part of her chest, and lower torso melt away. “Three men, who had been harassing me for weeks, had jumped over from the neighbour’s roof and doused me with acid. I suffered 70 per cent burns while my sister who lay nearby suffered 20 per cent burns,” she recalled.', 'The words she used were searing. “Us raat laga main maut ke aalingan main pighal gayi, zindagi mano thaher gayi, woh ek lamha zindagi aur maut ke beech atak gaya (that night I felt I was engulfed in the arms of death and life stood still; in that one moment I was stuck between life and death).”', 'It was a huge crisis for the family. Her father, Chandidas Mukherjee, employed with a private company, had to quit his job to be with her after the attack and the family shifted to their ancestral home in Kasmar, in Jharkhand’s Bokaro district. All the three youths involved in the attack were sentenced to nine years of imprisonment by the district court. They later managed to secure bail from the high court and began threatening the family.', 'A paltry sum of Rs 200 per month was made available to her from the government as a disability allowance. The entire sum went in medicines. The pain was overpowering. “For the first six months, I would scream in pain and sometimes fall unconscious. I would plead with God to kill me,” Sonali recalled.', 'She then decided to search for justice. “My father and I met the chief minister, all the legislators, NGOs. I even approached the National Commission for Women – after all, it was not just my case but that of hundreds of other women who face violence every day. The NCW gave me assurances, but apart from providing quotes to the media they did nothing. It was then that I decided to demand my right to die.”', 'Legally, there is no separate provision for acid attacks in the existing law. They are dealt with through Sections 320, 322, 325 and 326 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Of these, only Section 326 refers to being attacked with a corrosive object but categorises it as ‘grievous hurt’. Although this section allows punishment up to life imprisonment, most convicts get only a jail term of three to four years. Compensation, if ordered, is often paltry.', 'Says Sushma Varma of Campaign & Struggle Against Acid Attack on Women (CSAAAW), Bangalore, “CSAAW has documented around 75 cases from 1999 to 2012 in Karnataka. But there are many unreported cases. The National Crime Records Bureau cannot provide data because these attacks are not registered under a separate law or section. We want to stress that this is gendered sexual violence and needs to be recognised under a separate section of 326A.”', 'Shruti Pandey, a Delhi-based Human Rights lawyer, agrees that there is an urgent need to amend the IPC and Criminal Procedure Code to specifically recognise acid attacks as a crime. States Pandey:', 'But it must also be seen as a sexual offence. Most acid attacks are made on women and for sexual reasons. Equally importantly we need legal provisions for compensation and rehabilitation. There should be a dedicated fund set up for immediate and assured availability of monies for the survivor’s medical treatment as well as for their psycho-social support, reparation, and rehabilitation. Also, the trial needs to be fast-tracked keeping in view the severity of the crime.', 'Sonali also believes that the sale, use and storage of acid should be strictly regulated. She wants women to step up their campaign against violence. “Campaigns like One Billion Rising (OBR) are important because they signal global solidarity on the issue. We need to come together beyond borders to battle such violence. Look what happened to Malala in Pakistan. But, apart from social campaigns, we also need justice delivery. Only then can we have a gender just society,” she said.', 'Two lines from a song penned by Kabir Suman, a Kolkata-based singer and political activist, expressed my thoughts as I emerged from my meeting with Sonali: ‘One day you will see the face, smiling in the mirror, Sonali/Till then this song remains, waiting in your favour…’', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
2,2012-12,"['Archives', 'Step Up for Disaster Risk Reduction: Appreciate, Encourage and Empower the Female Voice']","['\n\n\nby\n\nKanchana V\n\n\nDecember 19, 2012, 10:24 am \n\n\n', 'The social role assigned to women as caregivers and nurturers naturally extend to disaster risk management, to secure life and the continuity of livelihoods, and to maintain the life support systems, in times of disasters. It would therefore be imprudent to understate the role women play in tackling emergency situations and in building resilience within their families and communities when a disaster strikes. Incontrovertibly, the societal position of women as agents of change needs to be stepped up.', 'Natural disasters devastate the lives and livelihoods of millions of people and cause substantial loss to the economy. Around 200 million young people worldwide are affected each year by reported disasters and thousands of them are killed and injured. A proper disaster risk management framework would enable the affected population, especially women, in taking immediate and correct steps in emergency situations.', 'In view of the transformational efforts by women in disaster prone areas, the UN General Assembly chose this year’s theme for the International Day for Disaster Reduction, celebrated world over on 13th October, as ‘Women and Girls: the [in]Visible Force of Resilience’. A wide range of events including tsunami drills and seismic risk discussions, gender-based violence workshops, community development work, poster and essay contests, panel discussions, gender awareness campaigns and education seminars were organised world over to celebrate the day. Women were given special awards and recognition for their exemplary work in disaster risk reduction and building resilience in their respective communities. United Nations has urged women and girls to be at the forefront of risk mitigation and disaster management. UN has also encouraged women to take up key leadership roles in disaster risk reduction initiatives and programs.', 'Globally, women need to be given greater space in the government’s disaster risk reduction programs and development plans for the hazard zones. Involving women as active participants in all aspects of disaster program planning and implementation would mean in true sense harnessing the hidden capability and realising women as a collective force of resilience. Educating and training women and girls in the areas of environmental and natural resource management; governance; and urban and land use planning and social and economic planning – the key drivers of disaster risk – can enable and empower them to bring sustainable development in their region and develop an implementable disaster response mechanism for their community. In this regard, UNESCO’s Global Partnership on Women and Girls’ Education has been training young women in disaster-prone countries such as Haiti, Myanmar, Pakistan and Indonesia on how to reduce their vulnerability to disasters and increase their resilience.', 'In India, UNDP’s Disaster Risk Management (DRM) project has been able to mobilize volunteers through the initiative. This sense of civic involvement proved to be an invaluable help during the recent floods in Bihar. Kiran Devi, a 35 year old, frail and shy woman, and a homemaker with two children, displayed the woman power and resilience when the floods devastated the homes in Duwania Chowk (Supaul district) in Bihar. She was one of the community volunteers who made a difference by preparing food for at least 2000 people whose homes and lives were washed away by the flood. Kiran made her way through 4 feet of water and also carried food for people in camps about 3 kilometres away from her home. In addition, she provided first aid relief to the injured in the floods – thanks to the UNDP first aid training she received in 2007.', 'The women of Villupuram district in the state of Tamil Nadu have another such fascinating story to tell. Every year when it rains heavily during the second part of the monsoon in November and December, the major inter-state Thenpennai River and its small tributary, the Malattaru, turn into demons, devouring rice fields and neighbourhoods. Planning ahead of the next round of heavy rains, village women take the lead in preparing communities for the hazards that lie ahead. They learn and teach swimming and rescue, store life jackets and makeshift rafts, and provide training on how to protect the community from the looming floods from both physical and human damage. The initiative is an offshoot of a micro-credit programme that a local NGO, Kalvi Kendra, has promoted through women’s self help groups.', 'A similar feat was shown by educated Indian women at the critical time when earthquake hit Sikkim in 2011. This time it was two superwomen in Indian Air Force (IAF), 26-year-old Arunima Vidhate and 25-year-old PP Ranade, who were two among the 18-member helicopter pilots. Vidhate, a girl from Pune, has been appointed at the Bagdogra airport was one of the first person who conducted a minute survey at the tremor-ridden region, especially the North-Sikkim, the worst affected area of the earthquake. She noticed during the aerial recee numerous landslides and how areas were cut off because of that. This helped the team of pilots in providing timely relief work, air-dropping food packets, medicines and other relief material for the affected people.', 'Recently, Nagaland State Disaster Response Force (NSDRF) trained a women’s team, equipped to respond to any kind of disaster. Ninety one jawans of 15 India Reserve Battalion’s (IRB) mahila unit recently underwent training at the Central Training Institute at Toluvi, under the guidance of National Disaster Response Force, Guwahati. Similarly, the community disaster resilience Fund (CDRF) pilot organized by the National Alliance for Disaster Risk Reduction (NADRR) in 2008 led to channelling of funds directly to communities in 88 villages of 11 multi-hazard prone districts of eight Indian states with the objective to address their own resilience building priorities through community and women-led initiatives.', '(Source: Adapted from WBI Distance Learning: Gender Aspects of Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction)', 'Oxfam India, an NGO, recently conducted a project on Women’s Empowerment and Disaster Mitigation in East UP and North Bihar. Among its various achievements related to community development, the project succeeded in developing a reliable and sustainable Community Based Flood Preparedness and Mitigation System that combines disaster management and livelihoods. Besides, over 7000 women have been covered under the Rights Based Education Programme that combined building basic literacy skills with awareness on rights and entitlements.', 'After the tsunami disaster when cyclone Thane hit Tamil Nadu coast in 2011, a large number of self help groups of women were actively involved in relief and rehabilitation process. They were also active after Nisha Cyclone in 2006. Subsequently these groups have undergone several training programmes on disaster risk reduction offered by Grassroots Organizations Operating Together in Sisterhood (GROOTS International), a global network of women-led grassroots organizations and Swayam Shikshan Prayog (SSP), an organisation directed primarily at women and their integration in the development process. These trained women’s groups came together and formed a Federation to work and offer their knowledge on disaster preparedness and risk reduction on a sustained basis. There are two such Women’s Federations; one in Cuddalore and another at Nagapattinam.', 'Though many NGOs and state bodies are working towards gender inclusion in disaster response training and disaster management, the reach is still limited. Not every woman in every disaster prone village is getting trained. It has therefore become imperative for disaster management NGOs and the government bodies to scale up and promote the role of women in disaster preparedness and recognise their competency in crisis management. Even though women have not received enough support till date, they continue to play a critical role in all aspects of emergency management in the disaster affected areas – from front-line recovery and supply issues to long-term community development to shape future resilience.', 'Gender equality is an essential element in building resilience to disasters. Time has come to witness more women as volunteers for disaster recovery initiatives and re-building efforts at the community level, as disaster risk managers at the program planning and national policy development level and as key decision makers in the government and international disaster management organisations. The key messages of IDDR 2012 very well point to the key actions that the authorities and the disaster management groups need to take –', 'Don’t ignore the female voice.

Such workers typically hail from families that live at the margins of society in rural India with extreme financial challenges. With barely any education or skills, they find it difficult to locate jobs that provide a steady and sufficient income. Of course, such jobs sometimes do not exist in the places where they live. As they usually lack money even for basic survival these people tend to borrow from land owning persons or moneylenders. This traps them in a vicious cycle of debt due to high interest rates apart from household expenditure. They are therefore compelled to work as on farms or in quarries or migrate/travel to urban areas to find employment on construction sites so that they can pay off their loans and also support themselves or their families. In certain cases, the landowners force the borrowers to slog in their homes or fields almost like slaves with hardly any regard for the well being of the individuals or the people in their homes.', 'Amidst this scenario of despair, there are some who have managed to free themselves from this bondage either through their independent efforts or with the support of other individuals or organizations. Of course, this involves a lots of risks for the people concerned and their defenders as they are most likely to face threats and attacks. Further, the local population, police or other government representatives do not always co-operate with the rescue agencies or the individuals, irrespective of the extent of violations of human rights and the law.', '47-year old Changalrayappa from Kelaholali in Mulbagal taluk of Karnataka’s Kolar district is one of those who broke free from being a bonded labourer in his childhood and adolescence to becoming an award-winning President of the Gram Panchayat in 2002. After he took over, the Panchayat became the top revenue collector and model for social initiatives. It also conducted health camps for women and free surgeries. Small wonder that it has been visited by neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, the Union Minister for Rural Development, officials from the World Banks and countries such as Bangladesh.', 'I started working on the fields in this village and its environs when I was a boy and could not study. In fact, my parents and four siblings also did similar jobs and we hardly had enough to eat. While the older people were paid Rs. 2/- a day, some of the children had to work for free. This was because we owed the landowner money. Although we had around 2 acres of land, it could hardly be cultivated as we had no money to invest in buying seeds or soil nutrients.', 'However, over a period of time, the family members began to learn of specific government schemes available to Dalits and Adivasis (indigenous people) to obtain loans. Importantly, they did not use any chemical fertilizers or pesticides as they grew paddy and ragi (finger millet). This increased the yield and revived the land while reducing expenditure, owing to natural manure. Changalrayappa says that his annual output is sufficient for his family of seven. And he has been progressive enough to get the land title in the name of his wife Narayanamma.', 'At present, Changalrayappa continues to be a respected member of the Gram Panchayat even though he is not its President. “Everyone in the village has great regard for Changalrayappa. He is sincere and determined. During the construction of the state highway nearby, the Panchayat had to be paid compensation from the government for land and water sources lost. When we suggested that he should procure information regarding the distribution and ownership of land in the area and funds entitled to the Panchayat, he made multiple trips to Bangalore to meet the concerned government officials until he was able to obtain the required details and money (Rs. 23 lakhs in this case). In addition to educating other farmers about the benefits of organic farming he has co-organized Jathas (festivals) and has initiated district level organic farmers’ networks”, observed M V N Rao, executive director, Grama Vikas Trust, a 30-year old NGO based in Kolar which has provided awareness to people like Changalrayappa about their rights and entitlements and also on natural farming methods.', 'A remarkable turnaround considering that Changalrayappa is an unlettered Dalit.', 'Earlier, our presence was hardly acknowledged. Now when we go to the police station, tahilsdar or other government office, we are offered a chair to sit. Further, the officials are willing to listen to us problems and suggestions and act as required. At home and in our community, at least some men have begun to respect us as individuals. Most of this is due to our achievements as members of our local sanghas (collectives) and the associated photo identity card.', 'remarked Kalamma, one of the oldest women who is a member of the board of governors of the Grameena Mahila Okkuta (Rural Women’s Union), a federation of nearly 400 village level collectives of women from about 200 villages spread across 4 taluks namely Mulbagal, Bangarpet, Srinivasapura and Kolar in Karnataka’s Kolar district. Started in 1994, the women decided to organize the sanghas into the Okkuta in 1997, one of the oldest and biggest in the state, which has shown the way for similar groups in many aspects.', 'Most of the 7000 women in the Okkuta are barely-literate Dalits who have been labourers in stone quarries or agricultural lands that are close by. The husbands of some of them own a piece of land but they had hardly been able to cultivate anything until some years ago. This is largely because the area is arid and also ruined by chemical farming. Further, many of the men preferred to work as daily wage labourers and waste their earnings on consuming alcohol. This led to domestic violence and also affected the food security, health and well-being of the family.', 'Realizing that they had to improve their lives and that of their kids, the women who used to meet to discuss their children’s issues decided to become financially independent. For this, they started small savings groups in around 7 villages of Mulbagal taluk with an overall strength of 79 members. As the sanghas began to grow in reach and size, the women felt emboldened to deal with the liquor menace. Through a Jatha (folk theatre) team that had women from 20 sanghas, they highlighted the need to oppose the availability and consumption of liquor. “At present, we reiterate the necessity of educating girls and caring for their health and nutrition. Further, we have been able to advocate against early marriage and pregnancy for girls, dowry demands, sexual harassment, female foeticide and infanticide and encourage family planning by talking to men, women, families and the larger community about the problems with these practices”, Papamma, one of the vocal members, revealed.', 'While dealing with socio-economic challenges, the women found that they had to tackle water shortage. With support and guidance from a local non-profit organization called Grama Vikas Trust, they have been able to undertake the restoration of water tanks to collect water. Further, the women learnt to engage in chemical-free farming. They also have understood the importance of creating seed banks.', 'We meet regularly at the village level to discuss our work and other matters. Apart from the above initiatives, we are seeking active representation in local governance structures like the Gram Panchayat. We have also raised our voice against illegal sand mining. To ensure availability of basic services, we observe the operation of schools, hospitals, ration shops and report to the government if there are shortcomings or dissatisfaction. We provide awareness to marginalized women on accessing government entitlements like training and credit for income generation activities, obtaining titled land for living and livelihood, pension for disabled, elderly or widows et al.', 'These ladies exemplify the belief that empowering them changes their family, community and the country', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

But Prerana did. And thanks to their efforts many of these children have been rehabilitated and now have the choice to pursue a different career path from their parents’. Perhaps that is the true worth of an education?', 'When Pravin Patkar and Priti Patkar began work in Mumbai’s red-light areas in 1986, they were often asked if it was worth “investing” in the education of these children. “Do their mothers care for their children?” was yet another question that would unfailingly crop up.', 'Well, they went ahead and their work has yielded tremendous dividends. They hold camps, workshops, counseling and do all that a school aims to do. “Give a complete education to the children and enable them to face the world,” is their motto. In recognition of its efforts, Prerana has been selected for UNAIDS for its view to end second generation trafficking of children of red light area-based women.', 'We know that the social stigma associated with the children of prostitutes in India often leaves them with no educational or career options outside of the sex-trafficking industry. It is generally accepted that the only things that manage to escape the Kamathipura slum are tragic images and stories.', 'Skeptics raised questions centered around the number of children who reached or completed an important milestone of the Indian educational system – the tenth standard exam. Prerana has shown clear results that if appropriate support systems are made available to the mother and the child, then the formal education of the child sustains.', 'Even today, the common question they often face is, “How come no one has still become a doctor or an engineer?”. In fact, a police officer asked this question to the people from Prerana, who were at the police station in Kamathipura to lodge a complaint against a pimp who had brutally beaten up a three year old child and his mother.', 'Whatever the skeptics may say, the work of Prerana continues undeterred – with proven results. Below are the stories of a few of the children supported by Prerana, which show the varied interests and the success they achieve in their chosen paths. All names have been changed in the interest of privacy.', 'Sharanya, who is now in her twenties, was referred to Prerana when she was 14 years old. Placed in a shelter facility run in Latur as she is from that region, she has now completed her graduation with 62% marks, with assistance and funds from Prerana.', 'Shailesh, again in his twenties and an orphan from Kamathipura, completed his Masters in Arts from the Pune University and secured admission to Bachelors in Education at H.K.College in Mumbai by clearing his Common Entrance Test (CET) in 2008.

Women’s University, Mumbai.', 'Jason is currently pursuing his Masters in Social Work at Jalana in Maharashtra state.', 'Susheel Kumar, a youth from Prerana, has completed his Bachelor of Science in IT from the Elphinston College Mumbai in the year May 2009. Even as an undergraduate student, he gave back by teaching in Prerana’s study classes in the evening. He has even held workshops where he teaches everyone the use of the internet and how much can be achieved with it.', 'To me, one of the most inspiring stories is that of KalpanaTambe who has conquered several challenges and even changed the mindsets of people.', 'She married Kiran, who had proposed to her after knowing her background. They both got married in Bandra Court as soon as she turned eighteen in 2004. Later, they also had a religious ceremony and took the blessings of his parents and grandmother. By then, Laxmi’s mother was no more as she passed away in 2002. Laxmi’s husband works in a courier company and she has done her BA in Psychology from Kalina University, Mumbai. They have a son who is six and a daughter who is two. Her sister too is married and stays in Badlapur where her brother is also studying.', 'Reflecting on her life, Kalpana said this to me when I spoke to her,', 'The most difficult thing which I have overcome, thanks to Prerana’s intervention and my mother’s determination and support is getting educated and leading a happily married life. Marriage for me was really important as it has enhanced my self esteem and made me much more confident.', 'She and her husband also made sure that the entire family knew about her mother. In fact, Kalpana’s husband said that he was proud of Kalpana as she had overcome so many challenges at such a young age.', 'Kalpana reminded me of Aamir Khan’s program Satyameva Jayate where Sunitha Krishnan, a veteran social worker who combats prostitution in Andhra Pradesh said, “We try our best to educate and empower women and children caught in this trap. However, it is only when society accepts them completely can our mission be really successful.” She went on to say that our society condemns the victims and not the perpetrators of this profession.', 'After I spoke to Kalpana, I was really happy at her true and complete success in overcoming all the challenges. To me, her story is a concrete and real example of India Shining and I hope to remain her friend always.', 'Actually, the work of Prerana also brings us to question how education is evaluated in India. What are the criteria that one uses to understand how well a person is educated? By the pay scales one gets in the job market? By the stamp of respectability? Or, by the freedom to do what one wishes to?', 'Very often the first major concern of any person pursuing education is how much they will be able to earn after the completion of their course. another important consideration is the title they will hold which will in turn determine their status in the society. The freedom to do what one wishes to; in other words, empowering individuals to make their choices, is, very often not even considered a goal of education.', 'Paradoxically, while the children from a privileged background grapple with the real purpose of education, Prerana seeks to provide true education to the children to enable them to understand themselves and find the strength to face any challenge in life.', 'So, the answer to the skeptics who wondered if the effort was worth it is, yes, it is indeed worth it and laudable.', 'Even if we ourselves are not able to do the kind of work Prerana is doing, we can at least support them and change our mindset.', 'Read more about Prerana’s work at www.preranaantitrafficking.org', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
5,2012-12,"['Archives', 'VSET “Living Values Movement”: Value Education – The Non-Preachy Way']","['\n\n\nby\n\nYoginder Sikand\n\n\nDecember 10, 2012, 10:18 am \n\n\n', 'Perceiving a void in value education at mainstream schools with conventional teaching methodologies, VSET is spearheading what it calls the “Living Values Movement”, \xa0a programme that aims to help children inculcate and imbibe positive values in a fun and non-authoritarian manner.\xa0', 'Modern ‘mainstream’ education is faced with a major crisis of meaning. Although it may seem to do well in imparting information, it miserably fails in inculcating positive human values in students. While it seeks to cram children’s heads with facts and figures, it does little, if anything at all, to make them better, more loving, joyful and compassionate human beings. Contemporary education being geared essentially to training students for the job market, children are carefully schooled in such values as aggressive competition, self-centredness, blind imitation of Western culture and unbridled materialism and consumerism. Positive values, such as concern for society, particularly the under-privileged, love, sharing, handling relationships, dealing with insecurity, failure, rejection, jealousy, anger and conflicts within and without the family, respect for cultural and religious diversity, caring for the environment and so on, receive little or no attention. If at all these values are taught, it is in a boring and preachy fashion, unrelated to the rest of the educational system, and fails to make much of an impact. How values should be integrated into modern education thus remains a pressing dilemma.', 'Set up in 2003, the Kerala-based Vishwa Seva Education Trust (VSET) spearheads what it calls the “Living Values Movement” which seeks to enable students appreciate and internalise positive values using innovative methods of facilitation that steer clear of the authoritarian teaching methods used in most schools. VSET’s slogan ‘Together For a Joyful World’ neatly sums up its mission.', 'VSET operates through a network of facilitators, who are trained free of charge. VSET facilitators now work in almost 200 schools, private as well as government-run, mostly in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, but also in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Chhatisgarh, and reaching some 45,000 students. In some of these schools, VSET pays the facilitators a modest remuneration, out of the funds that it receives from public donations. In other cases, two or more schools share the cost of the facilitator among themselves. Facilitators can be just about anyone–including housewives, college students, businessmen and others who like interacting with children and who also want to transform themselves in the process. Any school can arrange to have a VSET facilitator.', 'VSET facilitators interact with batches of students from the seventh grade onwards in 40-minute sessions in what are called ‘Joy Clubs’. Each Joy Club session is devoted to a particular theme or value. VSET volunteers have prepared a detailed list of some sixty values, which the programme seeks to promote awareness about. These include not just positive values but also adverse situations which students might not be comfortable discussing with their parents, peers and teachers. The values the programme focuses on as well as the material that is used for this purpose are carefully designed to be non-sectarian so that the programme has a universal appeal and is not biased in favour of or against any community or religion.', 'Drawing on the real-life experiences of the students themselves, supplemented by material freely accessible to the public on the VSET website, skits, video clippings, fun-filled games and interactive stories, VSET facilitators encourage students to reflect, discuss and voice their own opinions on a range of values and situations in a non-judgmental and non-authoritarian manner. The process is designed to inspire the interest of the students by making Value Education fun-filled and joyful. There are no exams to be passed or textbook lessons to be crammed, and so there is no fear of failure. The facilitator’s role is that of a co-learner along with the students, and she considers herself as their friend, whom they can be free with and fully trust. Rather than seeking to impose her views on the students, she enables them to explore and think for themselves, in the process also learning from them.', 'VSET facilitators also interact with teachers and parents of students, seeking to promote awareness of positive values as well as the ability to properly handle troubling situations. Plans are underway to extend the Living Values Movement to corporate offices and to spread the the movement to people from all walks of life. VSET is also approaching various educational bodies and boards to promote awareness about its programme and to encourage them to implement it in the schools affiliated to them.', 'Recently, VSET set up a small, picturesque campus in the mountains in Wayanad in Kerala, where facilitator enablement workshops are regularly conducted and camps are held for students from schools in nearby towns and villages.', 'Judging by the feed-back that VSET has received, the impact of the “Living Values Movement” on children’s awareness, confidence and ability to positively deal with others has been impressive. The movement has also enabled many shy or reticent students overcome their inhibitions. Without having been preached to, scores of students have, through VSET’s Joy Clubs, been enabled to become more socially conscious, positive-minded, creative and better equipped for handling adverse situations.', 'Says one enthusiastic parent, ‘The VSET programme provides children a platform to understand more about values, which will help them make the right choices to succeed in life, and to prepare them to serve humanity.’ Another parent relates how through her daughter, having gone through the VSET programme, was able to teach her the dignity of labour. When she asked her daughter why her teacher was seen walking with the school sweeper, she replied, ‘Every work has its own dignity.’ Adds another approving teacher, ‘Our students have become more open, confident and broadminded and joyful, better prepared to face the realities of life.’ The students, too, readily express the changes that the VSET programme has wrought in their lives. One student relates that she now takes care not to waste food and makes it a point to help her mother in household chores. Another student relates how the programme has helped a school-mate of hers become more loving and friendly. ‘The programme has helped me stop using abusive language’, says yet another. A fourth student chips in, ‘I now know that to build a good society, every individual has to change and contribute, and for that we ourselves have to become role models.’', 'For more information, see the VSET website or write to india@vset.org', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
