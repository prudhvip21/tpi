Together with his family and friends, he took steps to raise the status of Dalit women in the caste-prejudiced state of Rajasthan, and so Sambhali Trust was born in 2007.', 'Sambhali means the ‘Rising of the deprived women’. The essence of Sambhali is its personal and needs-based approach and fulfilling the needs of the women and girls who come to Sambhali for help. Sambhali Trust aims to make these women and girls independent so that they don’t need Sambhali anymore through providing them with vocational training and education that also improves their self-confidence and self-esteem.', 'Govind Singh Rathore, the founder, talks about his trust and vision.', 'Throughout all projects, the main aim of Sambhali Trust is to improve gender equality; to make women become independent in decision-making and looking after themselves and their families. Besides offering a vocational training in sewing and embroidery skills and teaching them Hindi, English and Maths, every participant is known to us personally; their reasons for coming to Sambhali and how we can help them through training with the increased potential of earning an income through their improved skills.', 'Govind Singh Rathore was just 14 years old when his father died and his mother took him out of school and made him head of the household. He found that suddenly his mother became an outcast from her friends and disrespected in her community. That was when he felt that he really wanted to do something to help women. He persuaded his Dalit maid, to bring her three girl children to his house and started to teach them to read and write. The next day, Meera, the maid, brought 18 girls with her.', 'Six months later, Sambhali Trust was born with the help of his family and friends; a non-profit charitable organisation to help with the empowerment of Dalit women and girls, the most vulnerable in this society.', 'Sambhali takes a holistic approach with all its participants to help with their welfare and that of their children. We have a Shelter Home Service which helps Dalit women and girls in the face of suffering received from domestic abuse; where they can stay in a refuge, receive support, counselling and advice. We support women who want to fight for justice in the courts. We have been on rallies campaigning in support of women’s issues. We provide workshops on Women’s Rights, Health and Awareness issues through presentations given in the Empowerment Centres including a Breast Cancer Awareness Workshop.', 'And there’s so much more that Sambhali Trust does – They provide self-defence classes and regular medical health-camps for check-ups and advice on health and nutrition. They have also provided the children in the boarding-home with free dental check-ups and treatment as well as eye-sight tests, and provided the means for an ear-drum operation for one of the girls. The Trust has been very impactful in all its endeavours.', 'From its earliest beginnings 6 years ago, Sambhali Trust has now developed into 12 projects; including 4 Empowerment Centres all providing vocational training in sewing skills as well as tuition in Hindi, English and Maths. We have 2 Graduates Sewing Centres, a Boutique outlet to be able to sell the items the Centres produce, a Self-Help Group project running for the last 4 years in the rural areas in the Thar Desert area, helping 89 women to save money and run their own small businesses. We have an Educational Project where 20 village children receive accommodation in Jodhpur so they can get an education in a good school, as well as sponsoring 135 children to go to school through direct sponsorship from individual donors. 11 ex-students have also been employed by Sambhali in one role or another.', 'The Trust believes in working with the administration, and has forged links with the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment as well as the Child Welfare Committee in Jodhpur. Sambhali has also been asked to provide education and activities in a government-run shelter for girls, and provided training for previously-run government Self-Help Group Projects in Jodhpur.', 'Sambhali Trust has won many awards for its part in working with Women’s Empowerment in Jodhpur and Govind Singh feels that there is a lot that needs to be accomplished in the future as well.', 'We are at present strengthening our organisation by developing associate organisations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland to help support us by encouraging more volunteers to come and work in our projects as well as support us in different areas of Education (sponsoring children to go to school), enabling village women to start small businesses by helping them to buy a goat, cow etc. Within the next year, we are aiming to maintain our current projects and open a new sewing centre with the women who have already completed a 6 month vocational training course; we want to develop their techniques for them to create well-made products that will be sold in the Sambhali Boutique.', 'It takes a lot of perseverance to get the trust of the women; Govind’s vision and commitment is worth a standing ovation. He has been successful in understanding the problems of the people who come to Sambhali in need of help and tries to support them in any way possible. He is not put off by minor obstacles and achieves what is necessary in a very short time, thus creating a dynamic force behind the organisation, continually driving it forward.', 'Digital media can help us to engage support in terms of attracting more volunteers to come and work in our projects as well as in gaining support. Secondly, we would like the public to know that we run a service where we work with professional counselors and psychologists for any woman who has suffered domestic abuse. We want your readers to know about our recent one-day conference on “No Bad Touch” – Awareness of Child Sexual Abuse which has brought several interested parties together from the areas of Health and Education in Jodhpur.', 'Awareness is the beginning of all changes so let us all make people aware about this revolutionary rising of the deprived women.

Pune and its surrounding areas in Maharashtra have witnessed heavy showers since the first week of June. The rains let up for a week’s time during which I visited a few places on the outskirts of Pune city.', 'The villages of Malkhed, Thoptewadi, Kharmari, Khamgaon and Mogarwadi are situated in the Maval taluka of Pune district. The word Maval originates from the Marathi word Mavalati, which means the direction in which the sun sets.', 'These villages are in the vicinity of the Khadakwasla dam behind the Sinhagad fort, which is of great historical importance. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of the great Maratha Empire, lived in this fort. His army, called the ‘Mavale’ was made up of the local farmers.', 'Farmers still form a big part of this region with farming activities taking centre stage. The short break in the monsoon has created a flurry of activity in the villages. Farmers have started harvesting rice and groundnut crops for the season.', 'Rice fields abound in the lower area because of plentiful water from the dam backwaters as well as the streams coming down the mountains, while groundnut is harvested in the top mountains.', 'The seasonal stream that originates from the top of the mountains is now full. It flows down passing through villages and ends in the backwaters of the dam below.', 'Farmers take their cattle to the full streams for a dip and to the lush greenery to graze before taking them to the fields. Women gather near the streams to chat while they go about their daily household chores. Everyone seems happy.', 'But this joy is shortlived. Come summer, the situation is very different. Streams dry up, as does the green grass. The villages on the top of the mountains face severe water shortage.', 'Villagers have to walk down the hills or have to depend on alternative sources of water to meet their daily needs. They have no advantage of being located in the vicinity of the dam since this water is diverted to meet the needs of the urban dwellers in Pune city.', 'Villages such as these have a lot to pick up from the traditional rainwater harvesting methods that have been used in earlier times in the old forts such as Sinhagad located in their vicinity.', 'Farmers in Kharmari village have constructed small bandharas on the stream, but that does not help much when the stream dries. Mogarwadi, which is the topmost village on the hill, has already constructed a talaab (pond) for rainwater harvesting.', 'Construction of more such structures could go a long way in solving the immediate and day-to-day water needs of the villagers in summer. At the same time, this also emphasizes the relevance of the current debates on the issue of the rights of the rural farmers to water from the dams, which is often diverted to meet the needs of growing cities.', 'Vatapoornima is a festival celebrated on a full moon day in the monsoon months, typically in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka. It honours Savitri, the legendary wife who rescued her husband’s soul from the God of Death, Yama.', 'Festivals in Indian agrarian societies often involve trees and rivers. They encourage respect and reverence for nature. Women tie threads on the huge bark of the ficus (peepul) trees and pray for the long life of their husbands during Vatapoornima.', 'All photographs: Aarti Kelkar-Khambete for India Water Portal', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
2,2013-8,"['Archives', 'TBI Specials: A Different Kishtwar – One Which Showed The Way In Religious Tolerance And Communal Harmony']","['\n\n\nby\n\nYoginder Sikand\n\n\nAugust 21, 2013, 12:30 pm \n\n\n', 'As curfew continues for the 12th straight day in Kishtwar based on the reports of communal violence, it might be difficult to imagine it as a place where Hindus and Muslims lived in perfect harmony, in fact much more than in many other parts of the country! But writer Yoginder Sikand recalls a time when he witnessed this communal bonhomie with his own eyes and felt it strongly in the many inspiring people he met on his visits there.', 'I hardly read the papers these days – who wants a heavy dose of negativity the first thing in the morning? And so, I had no idea about the latest developments in curfew-bound Kishtwar, from where violence has spread to other parts of the Jammu province. It isn’t something new though. It’s the same old, almost universal, story, of people who define themselves, and are defined by others, on the basis of religious differences and being unable to relate to each other amicably.', 'Unlike now, there was a time when I eagerly followed developments in Kishtwar and elsewhere in the Doda district, of which Kishtwar was till recently a part. I wrote extensively about inter-community relations in the area in the context of the armed conflict between pro-Pakistan and pro-azadi Muslim militants and Indian forces. Starting in the early 1990s, when violence was at its peak in the then Doda district, I must have visited the region more than a dozen times, meeting Muslims, Hindus and others from different walks of life. Each time I returned with fresh insights into Hindu-Muslim relations in the region, in which contested historical memories, religion, ethnicity, class, caste, gender, politics and international factors were all deeply intertwined.', 'I did a fair amount of writing for various newspapers based on my field observations in the then Doda district. I wanted, in particular, to highlight instances of inter-community solidarity that I observed which withstood the forces of Hindu and Muslim exclusivity, killings by militants and the armed forces and spells of communal violence that had wracked the region in the last few decades. I didn’t turn a blind eye to the reality of deep-rooted and fairly widely-shared negative perceptions that many local Muslims and Hindus had of each other. But, I felt that rather than denouncing them, I’d serve a better purpose by highlighting instances of Hindu-Muslim sharing. In that way, I hoped, I might help, albeit in a modest way, to inspire people to appreciate alternate ways of dealing with religious differences.', 'Kishtwar provided me many touching examples of inter-community harmony, even as the town didn’t remain unaffected by violence and communal polarization. Unlike in many other parts of India, where Hindus and Muslims often live in separate localities, in Muslim-majority Kishtwar there was no such segregation. Every evening, vast crowds – Hindus and Muslims – would spill out onto the sprawling Chaugan, an enormous field on the border of the town, to stroll around, play cricket, and generally have fun. Of how many other Indian towns could the same be said?', 'Kishtwar, elderly residents made it a point to stress, had been spared the horrors of the Partition violence in 1947, in which tens of thousands of people had been massacred elsewhere in the Jammu province. The town’s inhabitants formed joint Hindu-Muslim patrolling teams to prevent rioters from entering.', 'Bits of that tradition of camaraderie still survived. Many Hindus continued to visit the Astan-e Bala, the graceful shrine of the seventeenth century Sufi, Shah Fariduddin Baghdadi, in the heart of town. The saint is credited with having spread Islam in the region. The then ruler of Kishtwar, Raja Kirat Singh, is said to have accepted Islam at his hands and to have taken on the unique name of ‘Tegh Muhammad Singh’. Shah Fariduddin married a local Hindu Rajput woman, and the descendants of her natal family, who are still Hindus, continue to have a special role in some rituals associated with the shrine.', 'Kishtwar’s Hindus and Muslims alike also flocked to the Darbar-e Asraria, the shrine of Shah Fariduddin’s son, Shah Asraruddin. Legend has it that Shah Asraruddin miraculously brought back to life a Hindu friend of his so that they could finish a game of polo that they were playing when he had suddenly died!', 'As I type these lines, I think of the amiable Riaz Ahmad, custodian of Shah Asraruddin’s shrine. He was bitterly critical of religious exclusivists on both sides. ‘God is the Cherisher of all the worlds, and not just of Muslims alone’, he explained, lamenting the excesses of radical Islamists and Hindu chauvinists alike. Besides local people, even army personnel, Riaz Ahmad said, visited the shrine that he looked after, for, as he put it, ‘The doors of the shrines of the Sufis are open to everyone.’ Many Hindu farmers around Kishtwar, he said, unfailingly left a part of their first harvest every year at the door-steps of the shrine as an offering, and some of them came to him for settling their disputes.', 'There were other people I met in Kishtwar on my several trips who, in different ways, worked to promote communal harmony. I wonder where Imran is now, and what he must be doing as his town is up in flames. He was, when I met him, a handsome schoolboy – he must be a grown-up man now. With great enthusiasm for making his town a better place, he, along with some of his friends, formed a group christened ‘Message for Peace’, through which they got school students together to discuss burning social issues, including, and especially, communalism and communal conflict. They even brought out a ‘magazine’— photocopied sheets of paper stapled together – almost every issue of which had something or the other to say about communal amity.', 'Then, there was a bunch of friends – Hindus and Muslims – who got together to form the Faridia Charitable Trust, named after the Sufi Shah Fariduddin. They raised resources to help poor patients at the local government hospital. Hindus and Muslims numbered roughly the same among the four hundred-odd members of the Trust. I don’t know of any other trust in India with a similar sort of Hindu-Muslim composition.', 'I distinctly remember, as if it had happened just the other day, that dark, wintry evening when I had accompanied Abdur Rahman, one of the founder-members of the Trust, to the depressing, dimly-lit wards of the hospital, where he sat with patients, Hindus and Muslims, on their beds, placing his arms around them and whispering words of comfort. Thereafter, we met up with the rest of the core-members of the Trust at a roadside dhaba, discussing religion and politics over steaming rajma-chawal. The suave Ghulam Rasul, Chairman of the Trust, had the last word on the subject. ‘Religion should inspire believers to recognise the common humanness of everyone, irrespective of community, and to work for the benefit of all’ he said, as the dhaba-wala began pulling down his shutters minutes before the night curfew was to start.', 'Where, now, I wonder, is the exceedingly charismatic Asghar Ali? When I met him, he had just returned from an accident site up in the treacherous mountains of Padder. The victims were all Hindus, and he had made arrangements for medical supplies for the injured and for the bodies of the deceased to be sent back to their homes. This work, of helping accident victims, was his life’s mission. He had started it after his own sister and brother were killed in a road accident.', 'And where, in the midst of all the turmoil and frenzy that the newspapers are reporting, is the blind Ramanandi sadhu who claimed to be more than a century old? He was in charge of an ancient Shiva temple located in an entirely Muslim locality on the slope above Kishtwar’s bus stand. He was from eastern Uttar Pradesh and had settled in Kishtwar in 1961, never going back after that. We chatted about many things, but mostly about Hindu-Muslim relations and what he felt were the changes that these had undergone over the decades.', '‘When I came here’, he said, ‘I was taken aback by the very close relations between Hindus and Muslims. But now’, he grimaced, ‘things have changed.’ Yet, he went on, on the rare occasions that he stepped outside the temple, his Muslim neighbours greeted him politely. ‘They treat me very kindly’, he said. ‘God is One, and his light resides in every heart’, he quoted Kabir.', 'There were many other such inspiring people others I met on my various trips to Kishtwar and around. I made copious notes about them – and also about people I encountered who didn’t think Hindu-Muslim bonhomie was possible or even desirable – hoping to write about them all some day. Perhaps there is a reason why I’m writing this down today.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
3,2013-8,"['Archives', 'Sevalaya – Service For All']","['Read about a remarkable organization working from villages in Tamil Nadu, and exemplifying service in its every deed. With various initiatives ranging from orphanages and a school to medical care and an old-age home, it is interesting to note how they manage the many activities, and how these complement each other and come together as one cohesive whole.', 'There are a lot of needs in this world which remain unfulfilled. Many charitable organizations are making Herculean efforts to address the needs. Philanthropy in many cases is very specific. Some organizations address the needs of homeless kids by providing shelters and educating them, and yet others take care of older people who have nowhere to go. I have always dreamed that there must be one organization which can devote itself to wants of many – the children, senior citizens, et al.', 'This is because I feel that kids and the elderly get along so fabulously – they get attached to each other in no time. My daughter is a case in point. She is always enquiring from my parents whenever they go back to my brother’s home, “When are you coming back?” Elders can help with the studies of the youngsters and guide them in life. Youngsters can assist the elders in learning new age technologies like operating the mobile phones, computers, etc. In effect ,they can complement each other.', 'One of my friends had sent me an mail about Sevalaya as they were looking for funds. As I read about Sevalaya, it became clear that this was the one organization which was very comprehensive as it catered to orphans, senior citizens, rural women, and more. Moreover, it is for all, irrespective of caste, creed, religion, gender, etc. It is in rural Tamil Nadu, in Kasuva hamlet near Thiruninravur, to the west of Chennai. Sevalaya means temple of service. It is service for those who have nowhere to go as they are too poor.', 'Sevalaya has separate homes for destitute boys and girls – the Swami Vivekananada Boys home and the Mother Teresa Girls home respectively. It runs a medical centre – Mahatma Gandhiji medical centre for the inmates of Sevalaya as also for the villagers. This is so, as the nearest hospital for the hamlet is nearly 6 km away in Thiruninravaur.', 'Sevalaya runs a school – the Mahakavi Bhartiyar Higher Secondary School which provides free education to the children of Kasuva & the surrounding villages. Even uniforms are provided free of cost. The villagers being very poor, could not afford to send their kids to school. Sevalaya’s gesture of free education has changed all that. The result is that nearly 1450 kids are now enrolled in the Mahakavi Bhartiyar Higher secondary school. Sevalaya also runs the Swami Vivekananda Library and reading room for making reading popular among the youth. The library is free. It also has a mobile van, to carry books to the villagers for free, once in a week.', 'Crafts like book-binding, screen printing, tailoring, wire-bag making, etc are a part of the school syllabus in Sevalaya. This is possible through the Kasthurba Craft Centre at Sevalaya. Rural women are being trained in tailoring, with the result that many women have been gainfully employed – on their own and in export units. This is empowerment of women which is the the utmost need of the day and age. Moreover, it is at the grass root level, in the villages!', 'The old age home is run by Sevalaya for those elders who have no one to take care of them. These elders cannot opt for old-age homes where they have to pay for being cared for. Hence Sevalaya runs this old age home – Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa Old Age Home for such senior citizens. The elders keep themselves busy by watering the gardens, cutting vegetables, making envelopes, etc.', 'The Vinobhaji Goshala is another foray by Sevalaya. This houses cows which yield milk & those which are past the milk yielding age. The milk is consumed by inmates at Sevalaya and the remaining milk is sold in the nearby villages to support the numerous activities of Sevalaya. Organic manure is made at Sevalaya by vermin compost method. It is used in the garden and marketed as well. A green gesture symbolizing waste management .', 'Sevalaya is the brainchild of Mr. V. Muralidharan and his friends who were inspired by the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi, Mahakavi Bharatiyar and Swami Vivekananda. Sevalaya’s first home for children opened on 29th May, 1988. Many corporates, clubs, public associations and well wishers from India and abroad fund the numerous activities of Sevalaya.', 'The success of Sevalaya has prompted them to establish more units in 2011 and 2012 – in Vadanallur village in Kanchivaram district and another in Aayular village respectively. Sevalaya has a dream project – of starting its own University!', 'Sevalaya has been the recipient of many awards – Bharathi award, Best Green Campus award, Pramerica Award, Best “Social Reformer”,”Karuna Ratna”, Mudhalvan award, Seva Ratna award, and many more.', 'Sevalaya works on three basic principles – service for all without any discrimination, free service, and service with love and affection.

4,2013-8,"['Archives', 'TBI Special Reports: 8 Defining Milestones In India’s Social Enterprise Landscape']","['\n\n\nby\n\nPerzen Patel\n\n\nAugust 15, 2013, 11:31 am \n\n\n', 'In India, this quote by Yunus continues to be relevant even today as a majority of its population battles poverty. Socially focused ventures that provide innovations for low-income markets and create opportunities for a better lifestyle have however made significant progress in fighting this battle – especially since India got independence from colonial rule in 1947.', 'As India celebrates its 67th year of freedom it seems poignant to therefore pause and reflect on eight milestones that have played an important role in shaping India’s social enterprise landscape and the lessons they teach us. This list is by no means exhaustive, but rather an open invitation for dialogue and sharing of ideas.', '1. Founding of Amul Dairy Co-operative (1946 – 1950)\nThe founding of the Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers Union in 1946 and the Amul Dairy in 1950 has over the years given thousands of dairy farmers access to a wide range of domestic markets and spurred India’s milk revolution. The diagram below explains in detail how the Amul co-operative benefits numerous dairy farmers across India.', 'Amul demonstrated that the elimination of middlemen and the professional management of milk procurement could result in low-income farmers getting access to new markets thereby lifting them out of poverty. While Amul was not conceived as a social enterprise, it is a historic example of supply chain management that is relevant even today.', '2. Beginnings of Fabindia (1960)\nFounded by John Bissell to market the diverse craft traditions of India, Fabindia started as a company exporting home furnishings. By linking over 80,000 craft based rural producers to modern urban markets, Fabindia impacted rural artisans at a scale similar to that of Amul for dairy farmers.', 'Fabindia’s unique ‘community owned company’ model that promotes inclusive capitalism can be credited for the impact they have created. By providing a minimum 26% shareholding to companies co-owned by artisan communities, Fabindia not only offered artisans a regular income but also dividends from the company’s growth. Today, with a pan-India presence, Fabindia is the largest private platform for products that derive from traditional crafts and knowledge.', '3. Founding of Ashoka in India (1981)\nAshoka laid the foundation for the concept of social entrepreneurship around the world and started working in India in 1981. Their yearly batches of Changemakers – a community of social entrepreneurs that work to launch, refine and scale high potential ideas for low-income markets – has proven to be a successful model that has been adopted by several accelerators globally.', 'Ashoka’s establishment in India highlighted the importance of non-financial support in the form of networks, mentors and beyond to accelerate the growth of entrepreneurs working with innovations for low-income markets. Since inception in India, Ashoka has identified and worked with more than 350 fellows with innovative solutions from diverse fields and provided them access to funding, expertise and the global networks necessary to grow operations and scale impact.', '4. Establishment of SELCO Solar (1995)\nSELCO Solar was established with the mission to dispel the myth that low-income communities cannot afford or maintain sustainable technologies. SELCO resolved this challenge by not only creating low-cost solar solutions for lighting, water pumping and computing but also by providing a complete package of product, service and consumer financing through grameena banks, cooperative societies and micro finance institutions.', 'In a time when only a limited amount of financial and non-financial support was available to socially focused entrepreneurs and affordable solar power was a distant dream even in developed countries, SELCO not only sold and serviced solar lighting systems but also developed and scaled a business model for bringing rural services to poor families. In the past 18 years, SELCO has sold over 1,35,000 solar home lighting systems.', '5. India’s First Impact Investments (2001)\nIt was in 2001 that Acumen Fund, a powerful catalyst for socially focused ventures internationally, brought its approach to India and made its debut investment in Aravind Eye Hospital. Acumen went on to open its India office in 2006 and has since invested USD$36 million in 26 different social companies in India.', 'In the same year, Vineet Rai also founded Aavishkaar, India’s first for-profit impact investment fund. Aavishkaar now oversees four investment funds and over 25 portfolio companies across sectors such as agriculture, dairy, healthcare, water, sanitation and beyond in India.', 'The introduction of both Aavishkaar and Acumen in India showcased the demand for early-stage investments in socially focused enterprises to scale both operations and social impact.', '6. Social Enterprise Reaches Indian Universities (2007)\nEducation has often been seen as a stepping-stone towards positive change. The introduction of the Masters in Social Enterprise at one of India’s leading academic schools, the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in 2007 heralded a small but growing trend to provide formal training for entrepreneurs aspiring to create social change.', 'The founding of this masters program raised the academic profile for social enterprise as a career and created a viable pathway for the next generation of socially focused leaders.', '7. Introduction of Events that Fostered the Social Enterprises Eco-system (2009)\nSankalp Forum’s annual summit in 2009 was the first such event of its kind in India that brought together multiple stakeholders such as entrepreneurs, investors, experts and development partners to review the progress made within the sector and to set course for the future. It was initiated with the vision of catalyzing impact investments into social enterprises globally and has today evolved into a community of over 350 socially focused enterprises, 300 investors and 300 sector stakeholders.', 'The popularity of Sankalp Forum brought to the forefront the importance of local and regional events for the convergence of global knowledge and investment dialog necessary to further the inclusive ecosystem in India.', '8. Passing of the Companies Bill (2013)\nThe passing of the Companies Bill and along with it the mandatory 2% of profits spend on CSR activities is a historic piece of legislation. While the impact of this spend has been a topic of much debate, including criticism that CSR is simply a public relations exercise, the new bill is an opportunity for Indian corporates to embrace a few large social problems that government benefits have been unable to resolve satisfactorily.', 'Moreover, the bill is aimed at providing important financial resources to NGO’s, social enterprises as well as incubators and accelerators with the ultimate intention being for corporates to play a greater role in eradicating social problems such as hunger and lack of education which continue to fester in India.', 'Steve Jobs – though unrelated to social enterprise – stated, “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in the future.”', 'Similarly, not only do these eight milestones define India’s social enterprise landscape but they also act as important opportunities for reflection on the way forward – for entrepreneurs, investors, accelerators and governments alike.', 'We reiterate that we do not consider this a comprehensive list, and would love to hear from our readers on what they think have been milestones impacting the social enterprise and developmental landscape in India.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
5,2013-8,"['Archives', 'TBI Heroes: Abdul Kareem – The Man Who Planted a Forest']","['Jean Giono’s 1953 story, ‘The Man Who Planted Trees’ tells the tale of a shepherd named Elzeard Bouffier, who planted trees all along an Alpine Valley to recreate a desolate forest. Whether Bouffier ever existed in reality or not, we may never know. But here in Kasargod district of Kerala, there lives a man in flesh and blood who actually did this – a man who bought 32 acres of barren land and planted a forest there – all by himself.', 'Abdul Kareem, 66, of Parappa, Kasargod, Kerala had a liking to ‘Kavu’, the sacred forests of Kerala, right from his childhood. He would frequently visit his wife’s house in Puliyankulam village and it was during such visits that he noticed the barren hillside land nearby. In 1977, as if on an impulse, he bought five acres of the land for Rs 3750. The people nearby and even his family were not able to comprehend his action, and he became a laughing stock in the locality. The property had only a single well that remained almost dry throughout the year. Since it could not provide enough to water the saplings that he planted, he would carry water in cans from outside sources on his two-wheeler. This continued for three years, at the end of which, nature started responding to his unrelenting efforts and the trees actually started growing.', 'The change was now to be seen – birds came in flocks and helped Kareem by bringing seeds of umpteen varieties and started setting their nests in this new haven. Soon other forms of life also appeared. The ecosystem was developing at a good pace. In the meanwhile, Kareem bought another 27 acres of land and planted trees all over the place with the new-found vigour, motivated by the fruits of his efforts.', 'One notable feature of Kareem’s forest (that is what the Department of Tourism, Kerala Government, calls this place) which makes it a forest in the true sense is that Kareem never tried to interfere in its natural development once it started sustaining itself, rather he gamely prevented anything and everything that would interfere with the natural growth of his forest. He has never weeded the forest; neither does he sweep away the fallen leaves. There is no effort for intervention of any kind.', 'The forest has brought about amazing changes to the surroundings. The once dry well in the plot is now brimming with pure, fresh water. The underground water table in an area of about 10 kilometers has risen, it is said. The temperature inside the forest is markedly cooler than outside. Kareem has been living inside the forest since 1986, keeping constant vigil on his creation, which is dearer to him than anything. Visitors are allowed inside, even to stay as paying guests for a few days, provided they comply with Kareem’s regulations. Plastic is banned inside the forest; so is the use of automobiles. Wild partying, loud noises – all are a strict no-no.', 'Kareem has resisted various offers to commercialize the forest and to turn it into a theme park. Recognition has come from various corners, including the Sahara Parivar award, Limca Books Person of the year and so on. Visitors have come from many foreign countries. Still, one sincerely doubts whether this gem of a man has received the deserving attention from his homeland. However, for those who know him, the man who was once a laughing stock, has now grown colossal in stature, along with his creation – one that generations will cherish.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
6,2013-8,"['Archives', 'Swades Foundation – Building Capacity In Rural India']","['\n\n\nby\n\nAnusha Subramanian\n\n\nAugust 8, 2013, 11:45 am \n\n\n', 'Some of you might remember the 2004 Bollywood film, Swades, in which an NRI Mohan Bhargava (played by Shah Rukh Khan) returns to India and is inspired by the harsh realities faced by the people in his village to become an agent of change. Here is an organization called Swades Foundation that not only shares its name with the film, it also aspires to a similar mission – to change and empower rural India. To know how they are doing this, read below.', 'Chandrakant Pawar holds a diploma in agriculture, but the lure of Mumbai – the dream city pulled him to Mumbai in search for a better life. He stayed in Mumbai from 2004-06 but, the struggle in the city was not paying off. He was marred by the city’s pace. Dejected and disappointed, that’s when he heard of the work being done by the Swades Foundation in his village and he decided to move back to his family and to his community. He participated in the Swades Foundations’ Self Help Group Training where he got motivated to put his two acres of barren land to agricultural use. The annual income of his household through agriculture is approximately about 3 lakh. ', 'Today, a farmer by choice, he is a role model in promoting Agriculture as a lucrative career option amongst the community. He makes special efforts to reach out to his people, based in the city, to come back to their villages, where enhanced livelihood options exist; initiating a wave of reverse migration.', 'Chandrakant is also working towards developing a program on Agro-Tourism to show the world the beauty and culture of Rural India.', 'Sudham Mali and Balaji Patole are teachers with an unquenchable love for education. They run a school in a village called Pashti (which consists of 6 hamlets and a population of 282) since 1997. Children come from 8-10kms away to this school. Mali draws a salary of only Rs 1,800 for last 10 years, and he along with Patole spends double the time required to be spent as a teacher. Instead of an 8 hours job they do a 14-16 hours job to ensure that kids get a better education. The privately run school has a 100 per cent pass rate in SSC exams.', 'The duo has striven to create a strong mindset among village communities of sending the girl-child to school and to address the extremely high dropout rates. They have reached out personally to parents to ensure attendance and spent time post-school hours with their students to make sure they fare well during exams. Today, their school provides the students with English and Computer training, thanks to the help provided by Swades Foundation.', 'These are just a couple of examples of villagers in Raigad district who have seen changes and are bringing about changes within their own community. There are several other villages in the district that are seeing changes in the areas of agriculture, water sanitation and health programmes. And, they say none of this would have been possible without the support of Swades Foundation.', 'The Beginning\nOperating for the last 15 years as SHARE (Society to Heal Aid Restore Educate), Ronnie Screwvala started the foundation when he was just 30 years of age. Since then the foundation has come a long way. Zarina Mehta, also a founder along with Screwvala refers to SHARE as the ‘first phase of Swades’, the foundation has since evolved and been rebranded as Swades to mark its shift onto a different growth trajectory.', 'The single minded focus of the Foundation is empowering Rural India. Explains Mehta:', 'Our unique strategy is to engage, execute, empower and exit: to engage rural communities with corporate entities, young urban India, not-for-profit organisations and governments, to execute programmes that empower our communities to transform their own lives, enabling us to exit (although not permanently) and allowing them to serve as role models and change agents for the rest of the country. The ‘swa’ in our name Swades embodies this thought and forms the core of everything we do.', 'Swades currently operates in Raigad and some parts of Ratnagiri districts of Maharashtra in the areas of Water Sanitation, Education, Agriculture, Livelihood, and Health.', 'Programmes\nOn a visit to Raigad and the villages where Swades operates, one could feel the change that has been brought about. In Jambul, which consists of 3 hamlets – 170 households and a population of 858 – Swades undertook a health and water project. Swades research showed that children in the age group of 3-6 years were severely anemic. Swades undertook a 100-day health programme since September 2012. The effort was to bring down the anemia rate among children here. It is understood from Dr Vaibhav and Dr Hitesh who are Swades doctors working here that 78% children are anemic and of these 64% are severely anemic.', 'The dosage programme that started in December 2012 consisted of a 100 dosage programme wherein the children who were detected anemic was administered dosage to improve their hemoglobin rate. The dosage programme was held at ICDC centres and at the primary schools in the village.', 'Along with the dosage programme, Swades also designed an awareness programme on how to prevent anemia in children. The programme has seen the incidence of anemia reducing. After about 60 doses of medicine there has been about 96% improvement in the kids.', 'Similarly, another issue that Jambul grappled with was that of water sanitation and drinking water scarcity. Says Praveen Aggarwal, COO, Swades Foundation:', 'Most villages here face water issues. According to the villagers, the government facility provided was not enough to solve the water issues. For the villagers daily sustenance was more important than anything else. We therefore first looked at fulfilling the basic amenities.', '“We started work in 50 Gram Panchayats which has approximately about 150 villages. We set up check dams and revived spring wells to help local plantation. We actually got water close to the community through setting up water reservoirs, small water tanks,” Aggarwal adds.', 'Almost a year ago Swades team of workers also combed the Jambul area and found a good source of water to build a large storage tank. The storage tank has a capacity of 21,000 litres of water and has provided a distribution line wherein each house in the area now gets 200 litres of water per day.', '“The aim is to get water throughout the year,” says Mayuri Pashte, deputy sarpanch of Jambul Gram Panchayat. The villagers have also spent Rs.2500 each to get a tap within their house for the water so the women of the house do not have to go to the well to collect water.', 'Similarly, in the area of agriculture, Swades called in experts to impart training to the villagers in cashew grafting both in Jambul as well as in Pashti. Also earlier each farmer could only grow one crop. Today, that has changed and every farmer has started growing a second crop.', 'Farmers are being educated in organic farming and being taught how to increase yield. The villages have also started community farming. In the summer of 2013, they collectively sold 25 tons of watermelon in the local market which fetched them close to Rs 1.5 lakh. “There is in all 10 acres of land under community farming in Pashti,” says Chandrakant Pawar.', 'Swades also has a few programs for youths, imparting skills for making them entrepreneurs or self-employed people. “It’s more about entrepreneurial implementation through self-help groups, farmer’s clubs – indirectly taking care of under-employment of hundreds of farmers, training several dozen workers and plumbers, etc,” says Praveen Aggarwal, COO, Swades Foundation.', 'Explaining the Foundation’s strategy Aggarwal says, “We are looking at a transformational 360-degree approach, which means holistic contribution to water and sanitation, agriculture and livelihood, education and health, following best practices, utilizing modern technology and value-based approaches to cause an irreversible change in people’s life.”', 'Vision\nAccording to Aggarwal, it’s about touching a human being’s life right from birth to old age, so that their lives, education and career path could be shaped, sharpened and secured in the right direction.', 'The foundation’s strategy began with developing programs and creating community-based organizations in those villages where they enter with their rural developmental programs so that they do not require further resource investment and financial investment. Swades currently works with a team of 100 people and provides regular guidance on every program that they carry out in any area.', '“We have set ourselves a mission of empowering, creating a permanent positive change in the lives of 1 million in five years,” says Aggarwal. It is understood that Screwvala and Mehta want to spend Rs 50 crore annually towards social causes. But, they are very clear that it needs to be done strategically and with accountability. Additionally, Swades plans to leverage financial and non-financial resources of the government, corporates and other institutions to maximise its impact.', 'According to Mehta, Swades is a self-execution foundation and not one to simply cut a cheque and let execution of a project be run by someone else. Having given up her career in Media after almost 25 years, Mehta is now full-time involved with Swades. She personally looks into all the projects along with her staff.', 'Impact\nIn the last 5 years alone, Swades has provided 39,000 people in 139 villages in rural Maharashtra with drinking water and made inroads into livelihood, education and health. It has also created 276 womens’ self-help groups with 3,900 members and 111 farmers’ groups with 1,500 members.', 'Swades has so far been been able to cover every aspect of human life and under each one of these categories there are at least 15 programs in each. For instance in education, there is a component about building a capacity of the management principals and there is a teacher training programme and there is an English language and computer training module, scholarships, rewards and recognition, and in different schools building separate sanitation facilities for boys and girls.', 'Challenges:\nIt’s not been an easy road to tread upon too. Swades also has challenges. One of the first challenges Aggarwal says is that of scale. Let’s take the regular hemoglobin check up. 70% of my population is anemic. There is no technology which is available in a cost effective manner which can test people’s hemoglobin level and give me instant result, say in Rs 2. The current test is costing us Rs 20 or so for each individual, and in a day these laboratories don’t have capacity of doing more than 200-300 tests. These are issues affecting us, so scale is one.', 'Second challenge he says is cost efficiency – for instance, the spectacles that they were delivering to kids and adults who needed eye care were costing them Rs 150, but with a lot of in-depth research, they have been able to take it down to Rs 50. So there is a great need to cope with these challenges of cost and time.', 'The third challenge that he faces is that NGOs have a tendency to work at a slow place. So they are trying to change the culture in the organization by bringing in corporate governance, corporate efficiency, management routines, reporting, etc.', 'You have to professionalize the NGO. The social sector is now creating good career opportunities. So far NGO jobs have not been lucrative. But, if you want to attract good talent you have to create a magnet.', 'Apart from all the work in progress and the challenges being tackled, building a large following like most other private foundations using a business-like approach to social causes, the terms ‘scale’ and ‘timeline’ are other important factors to consider – getting to a level that is noticeable and which other people can replicate as a model.', 'This is where the goal of ‘1 million in five years’ enters the picture. In this process, rather than portraying Swades as just a philanthropic activity, Mehta endeavors to build a large following and inspire others in similar lines of work to contribute their brainpower to empower people and to then move on with their lives.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

The girls – a majority of whom played outside their village in Ormanjhi for the first time – were placed third after two wins, two losses, and one draw against international teams. Earlier during the Donosti Cup, Spain’s biggest football tournament, the girls made it to quarter finals from among 36 international teams.', 'The young footballers wearing red and white sarees and sneakers, with plastic flowers adorning their hair and around their wrists, were ecstatic as they won the third prize in Gasteiz, Spain that Saturday night.', 'Says Rinky Kumari, 13, the team’s captain back in Ormanjhi, grinning:', 'We had carried sarna sarees in our bags and some flowers too.

They would break into song and dance always even doing the jhumar (traditional dance) with a team from Spain at San Sebastian. The only time I saw them nervous was the first game,” recounted Sandeep Chhetri Yuwa’s secretary and the team’s unofficial cheering songs writer.', 'At the afternoon session at Yuwa’s center at Hutup village, the older girls break into giggles when their peers’ Spain tour is mentioned. “They saw the sea!” the group exclaims. “They told us there was lots of meat, chicken, even pigs’ meat. There was bread, butter, jam. People there bathe in the sea,” Preeti Kumari, 9, sums up the buzz among the children in Hutup since the girls’ return.', 'Shivani Toppo, 12, who has played football since Franz Gastler, a 30-year old American founded Yuwa-India in this Jharkhand village in 2009 and was among two girls from Yuwa who had toured with India’s under-14 team in Sri Lanka last year, explains her interest in the game. “It keeps me healthy. If I stay home I do not feel good. Also, Franz sir got all of us to go to good schools. He helped my family pay the school fee and now the school has waived the fee off,” says the team’s second defender.', 'Shivani’s family lives in a kutcha house in Hutup, not far from the football field. On her way home after the two hour practice session everyday neighbours would pass rude remarks, Shivani recalls.', 'They would say, why do you walk around in half-pants like boys. They would tell my parents that Franz will sell your daughter. My father died last year but I remember he would tell me that I should give it back to these people. So I told them that I eat what my parents cook for me before playing. I take nothing that is yours.', '“She must study and sports make her happy. She helps me out lift dung and clean utensils every morning before she goes to schools,” said Shivani’s mother Jhari Devi who supports the family working as a daily wage labourer in a plastics factory at Hudup since her husband died last year. “If she has to play football, she obviously has to wear these clothes,” says Shivani’s grandfather Dukhan Pahan.', 'In the three weeks the girls were on tour, 40 new children have joined Yuwa’s practice session besides the 220 who are already regular. Yuwa-India’s Executive Director Franz Gastler who had first come to Jharkhand four years back to teach in villages, sounds excited about the team’s achievements but at the same time is concerned.', '“We applied for land on a long-term lease because the land we play on is disappearing from right under our feet as land prospectors come in and buy up the land and put brick walls around it. Right now our proposal is sitting with the Sports Secretary, we do not know what will happen,” says Gastler.', 'Read an interview with Franz Gastler here and get more details including a documentary on the football team here.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
