It serves as a platform for voicing grievances and as a medium for pushing developmental programmes to this highly marginalised segment of the society. From financial support, education and insurance facilities to intangibles like dignity of labour and quality of life, read how a collective can change lives.', 'As they sift through garbage, they have to fend off rodents and stray animals, their hands get wounded by shards of broken glass thrown carelessly in the rubbish, and harassment by the police is part of their daily routine. In India, it’s hard to miss the large numbers of waste pickers, who, armed with large plastic sacks, scourge the city streets and garbage bins for recyclable waste to earn a few bucks.', 'Scrap collection is considered socially relevant, economically productive and environmentally beneficial “work”. In fact, India has one of the highest recycling rates in the world, thanks mainly to this army of waste pickers, which are mostly women. In fact, as per World Bank estimates, 1 per cent of the urban population in developing countries earns a living through waste picking and recycling.', 'Unfortunately, despite their very significant function in society, these self-employed women occupy the lowest rung in the informal economy and are generally treated with contempt. In Pune, however, waste pickers have discovered that there is strength in a union.', 'The process of transformation started in May 1993 when veteran labour leader, Dr Baba Adhav organised a first-of-its-kind ‘Convention of Waste Pickers’ in Pune in a bid to enable them to fight for their rights as legitimate workers and rally for a better future for their children. This meet was attended by over 800 waste pickers from across the city, and from this process emerged the Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat (KKPKP), a union of scrap collectors. “Every woman in the union is amazing,” remarks Lakshmi Narayan, General Secretary of KKPKP.', 'A chance meeting with a child waste picker during an academic exercise in 1990 led Narayan and Poornima Chikarmane, an activist and academic, to delve deeper into the lives of these workers. The women, they realised, did not even think of their back-breaking labour as ‘work’, but were keen that their next generation be educated.', 'What was needed was a change in their dismal working conditions as well as powers to negotiate a better income. Knowing that the collection and segregation of scrap at source could offer both, Narayan and Poornima helped 30 waste pickers to get an identity card from SNDT University, which enabled them to collect scrap from there. As anticipated, not only did their earnings improve dramatically – because source segregated scrap fetched better rates – they had to put in fewer hours of labour and the physical working conditions became better. Recalls Narayan:', 'But individuals and small groups have no power to counter the threats from other claimants to ‘wealth in waste’ and there was an imminent need to establish an identity for waste pickers as ‘workers’.', 'The KKPKP proved to be a perfect platform. Once registered as a trade union, it not only represented the collective identity and interests of scrap collectors, it also gave them a platform to voice their grievances and concerns. And unlike conventional unions, it has also focused on social development activities such as credit provision, education and child labour issues.', 'Suman Mariba More, who is in her 40s, recalls how she would toil from dawn to dusk, walking for miles with her sack to collect scrap and sort it with the help of her children. “All that changed after 1993 when I joined the union. Now I work four hours and I get more money since I collect waste from door-to-door. The quality and condition of waste is much better,” she says.', 'Door-to-door collection has social benefits as well. Simple pleasures like a cup of tea, a friendly chat or proper lunch breaks, in addition to getting soap to wash their hands and feet are just some of the unsaid benefits.', 'Over the years, the KKPKP has evolved with the growing needs of its 9,000-plus members, 80 per cent of who are marginalised women. Their identity card, endorsed by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), entitles them to benefits like interest-free loans and educational support for children. Two insurance progammes have also been started for them. For life insurance, members pay a yearly fee of Rs 50 while the state government matches that sum and the central government contributes Rs 100. There is also a medical cover of Rs 5,000, the premium for which is paid by the PMC.', 'For More, a higher income and health insurance has meant that she can afford proper medical care instead of indulging in self-medication. Not only are her sons educated, her daughter-in-law is a computer engineer from a Brahmin family. Even her daughter was married off only after she turned 18 and “that too with no dowry” declares More proudly. Where her work is concerned, she no longer segregates the waste at home but goes to her nearest municipal corporation provided sorting shed.', 'The KKPKP takes a keen interest in the welfare of its members – be it when it aided 72 families of a ‘basti’ displaced under the Rajiv Awas Yogana rehabilitation scheme in 2009 or ensuring the enrolment of elderly members eligible for the Indira Gandhi pension plan. Says Maitreyi Shankar, Treasurer, KKPKP, “Enrolling in state schemes can be tedious. On an average, it takes at least 15 man days to put all the required documentation together. We assist them every step of the way.”', 'For the KKPKP, it has been hard work building up a reputation. Says Narayan,', 'Ensuring that waste pickers as well as the larger society saw this as work was the beginning. We had to quantify their actual contribution to the solid waste management (SWM) system. A study to prove that they indeed save the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporations several crore rupees in waste handling costs was undertaken and it proved beyond doubt that these recovery operations were extremely valuable.', 'Armed with hard numbers, the KKPKP called for an integration of waste pickers in the waste collection/disposal system at the point of waste generation itself – that is, access to waste in homes, offices or businesses. The Management of Solid Waste laws of 2000, requiring segregation of wet and dry waste, door to door waste collection (DTDC) and processing, proved beneficial. In 2005, the KKPKP launched a pilot programme with the PMC, where waste pickers were integrated in DTDC work, paving the way for the establishment of SWaCH, a wholly workers’ owned cooperative.', 'The SWaCH DTDC initiative – based on recovery of fee from service users and provision of infrastructure support by the municipality – brings together two interests: Upgrading the livelihood of waste pickers and sustainable solid waste management. Through its 2,150 members, most of who belong to KKPKP, SWaCH services over 390,000 households in 15 municipal administrative wards of the PMC.', 'Work benefits apart, last year, under the Right to Education Act, over 100 children and grand children of KKPKP members were enrolled in good local schools; this year efforts are on to raise the number to over 150. Further, a training programme to educate members on the cash transfer for ration and LPG schemes linked to the Aadhaar card has been initiated. “It’s all about dignity, respect and quality of life,” emphasises Narayan.', 'Waste pickers have come a long way but many challenges still remain. Narayan says, “The fee for waste collection is as low as Rs 10 or Rs 20 and yet women do not get paid on time. People expect a high level of professionalism from these women without paying them their professional due.” When 70 waste pickers were cheated out of half their daily wages by one of the contractors, KKPKP members had held a peaceful ‘dharna’ in March 2013 to resolve the issue. While that hurdle has now been crossed, there are always newer battles to be fought. As Narayan puts it, “It’s never over.”', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
1,2013-10,"['Archives', 'TBI Heritage: Vikramjit Singh Rooprai – Someone Who Cares For The Monuments Of Delhi']","['Not many of us know that there are more than 1300 monuments in and around New Delhi! And more importantly, there are only a few who care for the 3 World Heritage Sites, 174 National Protected Monuments and over hundreds of state protected monuments and several unprotected and lesser known monuments of this historical and epical city. Today we proudly feature someone who cares; presenting Vikramjit Singh Rooprai – the creator of www.monumentsofdelhi.com', 'New Delhi, the national capital of India – its very name brings into mind the image of Red Fort, lanes of Chandni Chowk, India Gate and many other monumental visuals that are proudly associated with this city. What started as Indraprastha from the times of Mahabharata has now become the darling city in many chirpy songs and movies. It is believed to be established around 2500 BC and since then nearly 90 rulers from a dozen dynasties have ruled the throne through this city.', 'Each dynasty and ruler contributed to the architectural heritage of the city and today Delhi has not less than 1300 monuments within the boundaries of these historic cities, namely Indraprastha, Lal Kot & Qila Rai Pithora, Dar-Ul-khilafat (aka Siri), Tughlaqabad, Jahanpanah, Ferozabad, Deenpanah and Shergarh, Shahjahanabad and the Lutyen’s Delhi. This historical importance was enough for Vikramjit to work on an exclusive website www.monumentsofdelhi.com.', 'It is a website to spread awareness about the rich Heritage of Delhi. We had 1300+ monuments but less than 800 are left. Government of India controls only 174 and Government of Delhi controls around 300-400 of these monuments! Rest all are getting ruined due to heavy neglect. While the government agencies and several NGOs are doing active work to restore these forgotten masterpieces of architecture to their original glory, Monuments-Of-Delhi also wishes to contribute by taking the responsibility to introduce them to the world, so they are no longer ignored and lost in time. The website aims to talk about several ancient mosques, baolis, havelis, walls, gateways, forts, gardens and roads – all those monuments which define the spirit of Delhi.', 'Indeed, it sounds wonderful and very significant too. So how did Vikram think of working on these lines?', 'I am an ardent traveler. One day, I realized that I have seen half of India and around 8-9 countries other than India but haven’t been able to see Delhi properly. So I set out to discover and explore each and every monument and that was when I realized how ignorant we are! The city we live in has so much architectural treasure and we all keep neglecting or worse, spoiling it! So I took this initiative to spread the awareness.', 'Vikram also runs a club called ‘Delhi Heritage Photography Club’. With this club, he takes people to unknown monuments once or twice every month. In the last 2 years, his club has done over 80 Photo-walks and one major exhibition at India Habitat Centre, the details of which can be found on their facebook page.', 'Delhi Heritage Photography Club has become my life now. I not only feel proud, but also blessed that I bring dozens of people closer to their own heritage. I was working in an MNC, which is one of the top 5 digital marketing companies of the world. I was heading the IT Research Division. But this heritage passion took over so much that I resigned from this lucrative job and started my own IT Company. Today, the company I started 2 years ago helps me pay all my bills and I spend most of my time reading books and exploring the streets of Delhi. Many of my office meetings are followed by some heritage hunt.', 'Vikram has located and correctly mapped over 500 monuments so far. He plans to find all 1317 monuments and spread the word about heritage in such a way that every child in Delhi will start loving this city. He candidly clarifies,', 'I am not preserving. I am just trying to spread the awareness. It was a pain in my heart for how careless we are about our own city. We just keep cursing agencies like ASI and Government of India but how much contribution are we doing except scribbling on the walls and pillars! My club is now having 2000 members and spreading awareness about heritage through their photographs. Every few days, I am contacted by some new person, who is interesting in helping the heritage of Delhi. I am inspiring people to write Blogs about heritage and lesser known Monuments of Delhi.', 'What makes his contribution so praiseworthy is the fact that all this has been done by him alone. Monuments of Delhi is a one man army. Sometimes, he is supported by a few philanthropists; but most of the time, he works alone. Recently, he even organized a Mehrauli Walk with his club members and conducted a Heritage Durbar, where they talked about the origin of Sufism and the 22 Khawajas of Delhi. Vikram had invited famous walk leader Asif Khan Dehlvi to give a talk on Sufism.', 'Monuments of Delhi website is supposed to contain each and every detail for every monument. These days, I am reading some old books and trying to build up a huge inventory. The website you see right now is just a mock site with dummy data. Real thing is coming up by the end of this year.', 'We cheer for the dedication and passion of Vikram and whole-heartedly support his cause. People like Vikram are true inspiration who enthuse everyone around to take care of our rich national heritage. Shouldn’t we all contribute a bit to this noble cause and work to bring back the glory of old Indraprastha?', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
2,2013-10,"['Archives', 'TBI Inspirations: The Couple Who Lives To Change Lives!']","['Take a moment to meet Shibumon and Elizabeth – a couple who have come a long, long way from their home in Kerala to live among a marginalized community of snake charmers in the outskirts of Delhi, so that they can give the children there a chance at life! Read a story that will take your breath away and restore your faith in humanity!', 'Let me introduce you to Blessy, she is the sixth ‘child’ of Shibumon & Elizabeth, and sister to Blesson and ‘Blessy’ (the couple’s biological kids) and Pooja, Reetu and Reshma. Till a few days back, she was just another slum kid, abandoned by her mother even before she started speaking and kicked out of her home (if you call it so) by her relatives. Her father, a truck driver, who is rarely at home, could do nothing but witness this with teary eyes. A seven-year old kid, with dreams which she never thought would ever realize..she is Blessy.', 'I request you to take a moment and think about your childhood and that of Blessy’s. She is another normal kid who passed through abnormal circumstances. Today, Shibumon and Elizabeth are trying to provide her with a life and help her realize her simple dream to live.', 'The hero and heroine of my post is this young couple. You can read about them here: The team behind Bharat Seva Samity – and their efforts to change the lives of the kids in Mandi gaon (on the border of Delhi & Gurgaon). Honestly, I don’t find myself eligible to speak about them.', 'When a good friend, a college senior and a serial entrepreneur, Vivek Jhorar, first asked me to join him to Mandi gaon – all i thought was about my negative bank balance and the amount i could donate to another NGO. But, hearing about this couple’s 13 odd year struggle to educate the kids of Sapera Basti (i prefer to call it Mandi gaon) was an eye-opener.', 'With a ‘more than enough’ five digit salary, i often cursed myself for the career blunders i made in my life. And here, Shibu and Elizabeth are sitting in their modest one-bedroom home in Mandi gaon, telling me about their dreams to bring change in the lives of these kids, kids who otherwise would end up doing menial works or maybe, become anti-social elements. Shibu jokingly tells, “I can only follow Madam’s (Elizabeth) order” and laughs.', 'I looked at the kids and they reminded me of an orphan who once asked me about my family and asked me to explain how my parents love me. He was sitting on the wall of an orphanage staring at mothers walking their kids, back home from school. I was a kid then and i cried while cycling back home. That day at Mandi gaon, i was a 27 year old and I silently wept while driving back home.', 'My learned friends speak about change, blame the system, call Delhi a rape capital..while having their share of imported alcohol, in an AC room. Today, snake lovers are asking the folks of Sapera Basti (meaning: the basti or slum of Snake Charmers) to stop doing the only job they know. They want to protect snakes, and i hope they do – but they should also spare a thought for how folks in this slum will survive, including the kids.', 'And, here is a couple who left behind everything and everyone they have, traveled kilometers and days (it still takes almost 3 days to reach Delhi from Kerala), to ‘act’ for a change. I often wonder why Shibu wants to do this. He could pack his bags and move back to his parents’ house any day. It is his parents who support him and his cause, financially.', 'But Shibu wants to stay and be the change catalyst. His short term and long term goal is to find the right education for the other 42 kids whom he and his wife teach from their one room school (you can call it a shack) in Sapera Basti. Unlike the criticizing lot from my social circle and the wildlife activists trying to stop the slum-dwellers from performing the only job they know, Shibu and his wife wants to cultivate a young generation of civilized kids.', 'Every day, he struggles to meet the financial needs of his family and his mission. Every day he tries to educate the elders of Sapera Basti to take up a new and noble profession. Every day, he does what he and his wife have been doing for the past 13 years..to bring change in others’ lives. To spread colours in otherwise dark minds.', 'I am lucky that i had to travel only a few kilometres from where i dwell, few thousand kilometres from where i was born, to meet a couple who deserves a salute more than most people i have known in my life.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

It had emotionally touched many a heart at far off places across the country, and motivated many people to come up with help and positive actions, as we have shared before on our Uttarakhand Diaries series. This is the story of a group of doctors and volunteers from different parts of the country who came together for a noble cause of helping the disaster affected in the Himalayan State of Uttarakhand.', 'A socially conscious doctor duo of Dr Renu and Dr Sripriya Rajan from Chennai were fervently wanting to do something for the affected people. They tapped their ex-army friend, Capt (Retd) Ram Kumar, who willingly joined them leaving behind his hectic business activities. Together they hit upon the idea of conducting a Medical Camp in the disaster affected areas. Dr. Sripriya explains:', 'Our endeavor was, to be able to reach out to people ,who ,we felt were in need of medical help ,and do what little we can in our own way . In that process , we have had the humbling experience of stepping out of our offices and understanding what a natural calamity can do to disrupt the life of common people.', 'The flash floods had devastated the Garhwal Himalayas, cutting off all major road communications. Even the army was finding it difficult to reach remote villages in the mountains. Local administration and NGOs could not do much in these circumstances. The heavy rush of NGOs with their aid stores got stuck at the nearest road block and they mostly unloaded their wares nearby and left. The real needy ones were still yearning for the proverbial help.', 'Capt Ramkumar, with the help of his army friends, contacted a local NGO, Vishvanath Poorva Sainik Kalyan Samiti, an ex-servicemen welfare society based at Uttarkashi. Major (Retd) Jamnal, the patron of the NGO, was an energetic and enthusiastic local social worker who volunteered to provide the local backing to Medical Camp but only on one essential condition; that the camp must be held at inaccessible and completely cut off upper regions of Uttarkashi. He suggested Bhatwari block, which was 40 kms away from the nearest road head, involving a good 6-hour trek. The Chennai doctors sportingly accepted the challenge and started working diligently.', 'Once Dr Sripriya and Capt Ram had firmly committed themselves for the adventurous journey to high Himalayas, a flurry of activities commenced. A large number of their colleagues and friends volunteered to join their mission or to help them financially or donate medicines. Dr Jayashree Narasimhan, a pulmonologist, Dr Jyothi Shankar, a laproscopic surgeon, Dr JK Reddy, Pediatrician and Mr Krishna Kumar, a businessman friend of Ram committed to join them. One Mr Ganji and his family from Erode donated medicines worth Rs 3 lacs. Few colleagues chipped in with finances and Appollo Hospital, Delhi offered medicines worth about Rs 5 lacs.', 'As per the final plan, the six member team was to reach Uttarkashi by 17 Aug, move on foot to Bhatwari and set up Camp on 18 Aug and thereafter run it for 4 days from 19 to 22 Aug 2013. As the day approached, the support and scope increased beyond every one’s imagination.', 'When the actual journey began on 16 Aug ‘13, the final count of medicines was 91 cartons, occupying a TATA 407 mini truck, worth over Rs 12 lacs. The team was joined by a few soldier well-wishers from Indian Army who volunteered for the camp in their leave period. Major Jamnal had by then assembled an umbrella organisation of NGOs – Apada Pravandhan Swayam Sahayata Samooh, in order to channelise all resources and energies of different NGOs working in the area. They all eagerly agreed to join the team in organising the event. He had also roped in a team of doctors from Tata Chemicals, a local dentist and two AYUSH doctors too.', 'The heightened activities and news about the Camp had reached the local administration too. Distt Magistrate of Uttarkashi, Dr Pankaj Pande and Mr Sridhar Babu, the Distt Commissioner for Disaster Mgt, came forward and offered all governmental assistance for the Camp. That was most encouraging news for the Team. The DM had made available the entire premises of PHC at Bhatwari with their staff of about 10 for the entire duration of Camp. In addition, the administration provided about 40 porters for transporting the medicines across the 40 km stretch. The most significant assistance was the provision of 10 sorties of helicopter lifts from Uttarkashi to Bhatwari and back for the Team members and medicines. It was an unexpected gift from a grateful administration but without which the team would have had a much tougher struggle.', 'The weather played havoc and the continued landslides at Neelu Pani near Darasu Bend made the move of the team to Uttarkashi almost impossible. However, the youthful enthusiasm, daring spirit and sheer courage in the face of lurking danger, saw the team pass through the land slide on foot at night. Every member vividly remembers the 30 km long cattle-class night journey in the body of a TATA 407 from Neelu Pani to Uttarkashi.', 'The medical Camp started on a high note. The heavy rush on the very first day was not anticipated. People came from far and wide. There were almost 500 on the first day. On the second day, the crowd became unmanageable, touching over 800. The doctors had to forgo their lunches for the sake of the people who had come after trekking for almost 5 hours. They were ready to wait for any time.', 'The PHC activated all its tentacles and functioned much beyond its capability. The lab conducted 228 tests, there were about 11 minor surgeries conducted by Dr Sri Priya and Dr Jyothi Sankar. Dr Dinesh, the dentist, did 113 tooth extractions. Over 300 children were seen by Dr Reddy, the pediatrician, including few serious cases. The pharmacy with medicines worth over Rs 12 lacs was manned by a few qualified pharmacists. The support staff included volunteers from SBMA, Azim Premji Foundation, Tata Relief, Sahil Delhi, SPHERE, Shrishti, Pregya Gurgaon, etc. By the afternoon of 22 Aug, doctors had examined 2398 patients and over Rs 5.5 lacs worth of medicines were distributed.', 'It was an amazing experience to work in the midst of people whose background and personal lives were totally unknown to me.It was truly rewarding to work for genuinely needy children and innocent people.Each moment of the camp has touched and transformed my life. The team spirit was incredible.Though I am a pediatrician, the care and concern the team showed me was equal to that one would extend to a child.', 'For the people of Bhatwari Block, the Medical Camp by Chennai Doctors’ Team was a god-sent gift. The quality and high number of doctors, its long duration, the high quality and abundance of medicines and its conduct at inaccessible location will stand out for its uniqueness.', 'The doctors from Chennai returned from the Camp with the satisfaction of having done something for the genuinely needy people. It had been a unique and memorable experience working for the disaster affected people of high Himalayas surmounting numerous odds and difficulties. In fact, there was a perceivable positivity in the atmosphere during the Camp right from its inception till end. The enthusiasm, joy and happiness was contagious and pervasive.', 'Back in Chennai, the experiences of the team members have been received with much admiration and awe, prompting many more to volunteer for similar missions in future. The talks are already on for the next camp. So much so for the good Samaritans from distant lands.', 'Here are the contact details of some of the main participants in this cause if you would like to know more:\n1.

Or heard about people in dire need of blood, but not getting it in time? Now, such constraints can be a thing of the past, with an initiative that makes it extremely easy and efficient to both donate blood and find a relevant donor. Read about Friends2Support, and how they are making this possible.', 'Although blood contributes only 7% of the human body weight, it is the most important body fluid. In brief, blood supplies oxygen, nutrients to tissues, removes CO2, Urea, and other toxic elements, regulates body pH and temperature, and so on. Every hour, hundreds of people across the world require blood for a transfusion, a surgery or some medical procedure. In simple economics term, the demand of blood is huge compared to the supply from donors. So, the solution lies in educating people on blood donation, connecting blood donors with those in need and above all saving lives. Here comes ‘Friends2support’, popularly known as F2S, to address these needs.', 'What is Friends2Support?\nF2S is an organization that brings voluntary blood donors and those in need of blood on to a common platform, through its website – http://www.friends2support.org. A person in need can visit the website to search for a suitable donor based on the blood group, city or town. Five friends – Sheikh Shareef, Naveen Reddy, S. Koteshwara Rao, Phani Kethamakka and Murali Krishna – hailing from Narsaraopet, Guntur District in Andhra Pradesh, launched Friends2Support on November 14, 2005 in Hyderabad. The founders are all software engineers. So what made these IT professionals take up these bloody problems? In their own words, they ask us few questions back:', 'Have you at any time witnessed a relative of yours or a close friend searching frantically for a blood donor, when blood banks say out of stock, the donors in mind are out of reach and the time keeps ticking? Have you witnessed the loss of a life for the only reason that a donor was not available at the most needed hour? Is it something that we as a society can do nothing to prevent? This thought laid the foundation of F2S.', 'Friends2Support’s mission is to fulfill every blood request in the country with a helpful web portal and motivated individuals who are willing to donate blood. The vision of these friends is to be “The hope of every Indian in search of a voluntary blood donor” and the motto driving them – ‘Donate blood to save the most precious human life.’', 'How does F2S work?\nF2S is providing a nexus between good and kind-hearted people. At the inception there were only 200 donors, but now the count has risen to 100,000 donors, and is increasing. F2S is now India’s largest blood donor database. They have launched free SMS facility to blood donors –', 'The user-friendly F2S website enables blood donation requests in a date-wise format. It hosts a transparent database of blood donors, which can be accessed by anyone. It contains details like donor name, location, blood group and mobile number. If one finds any donor unavailable for donation or cannot be reached on the phone number, one can utilise the “Report” option beside every donor name. F2S has compiled a comprehensive ‘State-District-Location’ database in the Country (almost 8000+ locations in India). Everyone can get a voluntary blood donor within hours at zero cost. F2S reports that approximately 300 people are donating blood every day through this website. After donating blood, donor name will be hidden till next 90 days to avoid calls to him. On 91st day his name will be automatically visible in the search results.', 'Future Plans\nLeveraging technology and adding mobility to the platform, F2S has launched several mobile apps to provide smart solutions for finding and/or registering as blood donors. Development of these apps has certainly driven efficiency and penetration among the people. In the future, F2S plans to set up a Global Positioning System (GPS) tracker, which will automatically detect the location of the caller, and send details of available blood donors along with the status of the availability of the donor to the caller, through voluntary call analysts, having sound regional knowledge, in every single state.', 'Reaching Out\nF2S does understand the taboos on blood donation and has focused extensively on raising awareness of people on this front. To reach out to people across villages and cities it has partnered with several social organizations/associations and government hospitals. To catch attention it has conducted bike and cycle rallies in Tier-2 cities and several towns. To reach out to office-goers and their families it has conducted camps and sessions with multiple corporates in different parts of India. It also participated in Joy of Giving Week last October. F2S members and supporters have used social media extensively and the top focus always remains to help the rural masses and poor people. Owing to the above monstrous efforts, they have seen people seeking help from Vadodara to Jabalpur and donors from Punjab to Kerala.', 'Friends2support also works to provide educational support to brilliant students who have discontinued their studies because of unfortunate circumstances. Read about its notable work with the marginalised families of the society in rural Andhra Pradesh here.', 'Support\nF2S does not encourage any donations; it runs with its own funds. What it really requires is your helping hand – lower your arm and give the gift of life by donating blood. Throw away the taboos and spread the wonderful message of blood donation. In fact, a lot of facts, misconceptions and questions related to blood donations are documented in the F2S website here. You can also join their app development team, currently Shareef and his friends are looking out for volunteers to develop F2S Blackberry app.', 'Recognition\nOwing to this tremendous effort by F2S in the last 7 years, it has been recognised by Limca Book of Records, mBillionth South Asia Award in 2013, UN Millennium development goals Award, Manthan award and also Nominated for Nasscom Social Innovation Honours. Awards do bring gratification, but the F2S founding team feels inspired when they look back and find 1,50,000 lives saved so far. This goes above all human awards – it is a godly act.', 'Install ‘friends2suppot.org’ app in your Android, windows and iOS phones to assist people around you when they require blood.

She can be legitimately hailed as the mother of Indian Feminism. Read about her remarkable life of courage and initiative.', '“You owe her. But do you know her? Savitribai Phule, the Mother of modern education. If you are an Indian woman who reads, you owe her. If you are an educated Indian woman, you owe her. If you are an Indian schoolgirl reading this chapter in English, you owe her. If you are an educated international desi woman, you owe her.” – Excerpted from ‘Savitribai and India’s Conversation on Education’ by Thom Wolf and Suzana Andrade, published in ‘Oikos Worldviews Journal’ (2008).', 'As a new bride at the age of nine, when Savitribai moved to her marital home in Pune in 1840, her most prized possession was a book that had been given to her by some Christian missionary. Impressed by her thirst for learning, Jotirao Phule, her husband, then all of 13, taught her to read and write, little knowing that this would lay the foundation for a whole new chapter in Indian history. In times when women were treated no better than the cattle at home, Savitribai Phule earned the distinction of being the first Indian woman to become a teacher. For this she undertook training at Ms. Farar’s Institution at Ahmednagar and in Ms. Mitchell’s school in Pune. “The first Indian to place universal, child sensitive, intellectually critical, and socially reforming education at the very core of the agenda for all children in India”, is how Wolf and Andrade describe her in their paper.', 'Long believed to be the preserve of the Brahmins, children from other castes and communities were denied the right to an education. Savitribai and her husband broke the rules and established the first school for girls in 1848 in Bhide Wada, Narayan Peth, Pune. Eight girls, belonging to different castes, enrolled as students on the first day. When she started her unique school, Savitribai also overcame another hurdle – of women not being allowed to step outside the home to work. Of course, the young woman had to contend with a lot of opposition. She carried a change of sari with her every day as men pelted her with stones, mud and even dung as she made her way to the school. But undeterred by all the opposition, Savitribai opened another school for adults the same year. By 1851, she was running three schools with around 150 girl students.', '“Women who cite harassment as a reason to quit what they want to do can learn a lot from Savitribai,” feels Sushama Deshpande, actor, writer and director of Marathi theatre. A journalist by training, she has written and directed the play, ‘Vhay, Mee Savitri Bai’ (‘Yes… I am Savitri Bai’), based on the life and works of the educationist. Today, 24 years later, too, the play inspires and enthralls audiences across the world. “Theatre journalism, as I call it, is my way of reaching out to women from all walks of life and telling them how strong they are through stories like that of Savitribai’s,” she says.', 'Today, government programmes like the ‘Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’, the Right to Education Act and the midday meal scheme that incentivize education, may seem like modern concepts, but even 150 years back Savitribai had set a precedent – she gave stipends to prevent children from dropping out of school. She was the teacher who inspired a young student to ask for a library for the school at an award ceremony instead of gifts for herself. A poet and writer, Savitribai had motivated another young girl, Mukta, to write an essay that became the cornerstone of ‘Dalit literature’. She even conducted the equivalent of a parent-teacher meeting to involve the parents so they would understand the importance of education and support their children. Her schools imparted vocational training as well.', 'Along with educating women, Savitribai also took on the responsibility for the health and well-being of young widows, another exploited group. A poster from 1863 reads something like this: “Women who conceive out of wedlock should go to the home of Jotirao Govindrao Phule for their confinement. Their names will be kept confidential”. Pained by the plight of young Kashibai, a widow sentenced to ‘Kalapani’ rigorous imprisonment in the Andamans for killing her newborn, the Phules opened up their home as a shelter for young widows. Raped by family members and then disowned when pregnant, these women often resorted to suicide or killed their babies. The couple even adopted one child as their own.', 'Yeshwant, their adopted son, trained as a doctor and eventually joined his mother in all the good work she did. Setting an example for others, she conducted his wedding under the ‘Satya shodhak samaj’, or the truth-seekers society, with no priests, no dowry and at very little expense. She even brought her son’s fiancée for a home stay before the wedding, so she could get familiar with her soon-to-be home and family. Moreover, she took on the household chores so the young woman had time to study.', 'Maybe if soaps today had mothers-in-law like her instead of the scheming kitchen politics they show on TV, we may have reduced dowry deaths and other social problems.', 'laments Mridu Verma a journalist-turned-entrepreneur. “Savitribai is an Indian icon who realised the true meaning of women’s liberation long before it became fashionable,” she adds.', 'Savitribai and Jotirao were always there for the community. In 1877, their region was hit by a severe drought. The couple launched the ‘Victoria Balashram’ and aided by friends and funds collected by going from village to village, they fed over a thousand people every day. Earlier in 1868, during a very dry spell, they had opened up their wells to the Dalits, who were forbidden to draw water from other wells.', 'Stories of her personal generosity are legend. No one visiting the Phule home would go empty handed. At the very least they would be assured of a meal. She would give away her saris too, if she saw anyone in torn saris. Extremely hands on, she looked after all the young widows who came to their house to have their babies. She also personally nursed husband Jotirao to health when a stroke paralysed him.', 'says Harish Sadani of Men Against Violence and Abuse (MAVA), an all-men organisation directly intervening in gender-based violence against women. Sadani admits that he is influenced by her more than by any western thinker.', 'Savitribai broke yet another taboo when she led the funeral procession of her husband. Even today, the Hindu last rites are considered to be the sacred privilege of men alone. When Jotiba passed away in 1890, warring relatives tried to wrest the rights of performing the last rites away from Yeshwant, faulting his parentage. Savitribai took the ‘titve’, or the funeral mud-pot, herself and led the procession.', 'Even the fear of death did not deter this brave woman from doing what she felt was right. In 1897, when the plague hit Pune, she was at the forefront. She even carried young Pandurang Babaji Gaikwad, a 10-year-old boy, from Mundhwa to the clinic strapped to her back. Ironically, he beat the infection but Savitribai caught it and in March 1897, she breathed her last.', '“Every Indian woman who is educated today owes Savitribai a debt of gratitude,” sums up Sushama Deshpande, whose play has now been adapted by many and is preformed extensively to packed houses, adding,', 'Not a single performance goes by without a few women coming backstage to tell me how watching the play has helped them find solutions to their personal problems. She epitomises the aspirations of women even 150 years after she burst on the scene.', 'Today, the school Savitribai had set up is part of Pune’s ‘heritage’ walk, a reminder that her legacy needs to be carried forward for the generations that follow.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Now, with an ensemble of 14 beautiful Persian cats, she runs a ‘Cat Pet Therapy Centre’ in Bangalore, helping children develop and discover their emotional side. Read more as the ‘Cat Lady’ lets the cat out of the bag on the secret to her happiness!', 'Meeting Rehana Mohammed Shakir was a very special treat. Here was someone who puts her pets and their comfort on top priority! Setting off with a friend on a cloudy morning to Rehana’s place, I imagined her house to be echoing with meows! After all, I had heard about the more-than-dozen cats she shared her home with! Just as we rang the doorbell, lo and behold! right at the gate we spotted a fluffy, orange-coloured majestic Persian cat welcoming us. “This is Toffee Shakir, my CEO!” Rehana said welcoming us. Petite and pretty, Rehana has ‘inherited’ most of the traits of her 14 Persian cats – she’s independent, straightforward, warm-hearted, and has a no-nonsense attitude to life.', 'Hailing from Lucknow, Rehana shifted to Mumbai, and then to Bangalore. She has worked in several advertising agencies, and has a wealth of experience of nearly 20 years in the advertising field. She discovered her love for cats a few years ago, when she adopted her very first kitten to keep her company at home. That was Shehzad, a royal-looking cat – she points to his picture embossed on a mug that graces a mantelpiece. Gradually, sensing her pet’s need for a playmate, she adopted one more, and so the Persian team grew!', 'Crazy about cats and all other animals, a little less than a year ago, Rehana decided to combine her training in alternative healing with her passionate love for animals, starting perhaps the only cat pet therapy centre in Bangalore. For a small fee, children can come to Rehana’s home and spend time playing with, learning from, loving and receiving love from her cats.', 'Rehana feels that there is no better way for a child to let off steam than to bask in the affection of an army of fluffy kittys. The idea behind ‘Rehana Mohammed Shakir’s Pet Therapy with Persian Cats’ came from a personal loss, when she lost her beloved cat, Shehzad, who succumbed to renal failure after a long and tedious battle. She admits:', 'When I lost Shehzad, I was devastated. For a very long time, I kept trying to find love in every animal I saw. Even the ones on the streets. That is when I truly realized that animals are intelligent beings blessed with the power of unconditional love, spiritual healing and the ability to make anyone feel instantly better with their demonstration of affection.', 'So began Rehana’s journey to educate people about not just the physical, but also the emotional, needs of animals and the joy of being able to give love and get love unconditionally from them.', 'Rehana’s pet therapy centre – which is housed in the apartment where she lives – is a space where parents can bring their children to get a first-hand feel of furry felines. Rehana believes that for kids, it simply isn’t enough to be exposed to book learning and sports – which is much of what conventional schooling is about these days. It’s also important for them to develop their emotional intelligence and learn the art of learning how to love and be loved in return. And that’s where pet therapy comes in.', 'Working primarily with children, Rehana not only encourages parents to allow their children to interact with her cats freely, but she also educates parents about the fact that with a great pet comes great responsibility.', 'Though there are many institutions that offer healing programmes assisted by animals, Rehana’s team of 14 Persian cats seems to be the first of its kind. “Cats are ‘little people’ with their own personalities and emotional needs,” she explains. One of her cats, Qamaruddin, she says, is amazing with hyper children with aggressive tendencies. He instinctively inspires kindness, gentleness and compassion. Toffee and Zafran work very well with quiet, withdrawn kids. They bring out joy in them. And Shahryar reaches out to just about anyone! He loves to be hugged!', 'The day I met Rehana, she was all set to bring another cat, Kainaat, to her home. “She was in a security guard’s cabin with a twine around her neck as a leash. I tried to help find her a family and when none came forward, our home is now going to become hers,” Rehana beamed.', 'Rehana started the Pet Therapy Programme when she had just 30 rupees in her pocket, a broken phone and a dead laptop. She explains:', 'It was my answer to the world that mocked me for my choice – of putting an animal before my own comforts. Hidden in the programme was the wealth of love that my cats had brought to my life and which they unhesitatingly shared with the world. I knew the loose change we earn through this programme wouldn’t pay even for cat feed. But I just had to do it. I promised myself that if I had to, I would even sell my belongings to keep my kitty family together and sustain what we do. That’s because I believed in it..with passion!', 'It hasn’t been smooth-going for Rehana. She has faced whispers from well-wishers advising her to “give the cats away” and “lead her life.” In reply to this, Rehana’s post on her Facebook page is truly inspiring:', 'When the going gets tough […], You do not give up lives whose responsibility and love is a commitment you made. There is a force way powerful than all of us – that creates the means and protects each life…I do what I do for I believe in it and believe in the humanity within me and in those of my dearest friends who never gave up on me, who backed me with all their might. And that’s why we still do what we do. Not for glory. Not for gain!', 'Spending time getting to know Rehana, her mission and her 14 lovely cats was a truly enlightening experience. I learnt the value of peace, which her fluffy friends radiated. Their calmness and dignity were a clear reflection of a deep contentment, a lesson which I might never have learnt if I sat with 14 “learned” scholars for 14 hours or 14 days!', '(If you are passionate about cats, you could add a bag of cat food to your shopping list as a gift for Rehana’s furry friends!)', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
7,2013-10,"['Archives', 'CanSupport: Care And Support For Cancer Patients']","['CanSupport, a wonderful initiative aiming to enable people with advanced cancer and their families in making informed choices and decisions, has received an overwhelming response for providing appropriate physical, emotional, social and spiritual support to cancer patients and their families. Harmala Gupta, the lady behind the mission, joins us to talk about this dedicated NGO.', 'It must have been the tender personal experience of Ms. Harmala Gupta, a survivor of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which motivated her to start an NGO dedicated to take care of Cancer patients in 1999. She, along with a group of like-minded volunteers, started providing much-needed information, support and meaningful care to people with advanced cancer.', 'The organization, CanSupport, has done a great job in the last 14 years and what keeps the team motivated is the visible change they see on the ground, the positive feedback and support they get from the users of their services, and the encouragement they receive from peers both in India and abroad.', 'After my personal experience with cancer, I started a support group for cancer survivors and their caregivers in Delhi. It came out of the realization that all cancer patients need information and emotional support. As part of our activities we began to visit the cancer hospital at AIIMS. Over a period of time, I felt that the majority of patients who came for treatment had advanced disease and that once their cancers recurred and their cancer treatments stopped they had nowhere to go for ongoing care and support. My concern also was that not only would they fall prey to unscrupulous people offering them cures at a price they could ill afford, but that they would die, miserably, in pain. This is how the idea of starting an organization like CanSupport, that would guide people as well as provide active medical, nursing and counselling care at home to ensure continued quality of life, emerged.', 'As expected, CanSupport has received an overwhelming positive response for the services offered and the care they provide. A lot of patients have expressed their gratitude to the organization for providing them with trained professionals who also visit them at home and do their best to keep them comfortable right till the end of life and prepare them and their families for what lies ahead.', 'We are often told by families that the day our teams visit, the patient is up early, eager to interact with the team members who they now regard as friends and confidants. The fact that the service is free, that medicines and medical equipment is given to those who can not purchase them, that rations and start-up funds are available to the indigent, and that our teams are in touch with patients 24×7, are all reasons why cancer patients and their families value our services. The funds to finance our services come from a variety of sources: individuals, foundations and trusts, and fundraising events like our annual ‘Walk for Life’ held on the first Sunday in February.', 'For the knowledge of our readers, CanSupport organizes an annual walk-a-thon called ‘Walk for Life’ in New Delhi. This year, Smt. Gursharan Kaur, wife of the Hon’ble Prime Minister flagged off the ‘Walk for Life’ at India Gate on February 3, 2013. She has been the chief patron of ‘Walk For Life’ and has been leading from the front ever since this walk was conceptualized. This year, there were more than 10,000 participants including corporate houses, supporters, members of the diplomatic corps and even a few cancer-survivors.', 'Another distinguishing service of CanSupport is the Helpline service that operates from Monday to Friday, from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm.', 'As cancer still carries a stigma in this country, people often are unwilling to have a face-to-face interaction. A confidential helpline enables them to ask for help without feeling threatened. The helpline also overcomes the barrier of distance. People no matter where they are located can phone in and ask for information, advice or just share their feelings. The helpline maintains a directory of services and local organizations for callers who may want financial assistance for drugs, wigs and prostheses, blood donors, etc. The helpline also serves as a referral to our services: home care, day care and support group meetings. The fact that the helpline is run by well-informed, mature and trained staff is an additional asset.', 'CanSupport has been doing a wonderful job and the need for their home care services is growing not only in Delhi and its neighbouring areas, but all over the region. Consequently, their future plans include expanding their footprint not only in Delhi but in contiguous states as well. This will be done through collaborations with government and private agencies, with CanSupport providing training and monitoring the growth and development of these initiatives. Besides raising more teams, they are also feeling the need to start an in-patient facility as well as OPDs, with day care activities and counseling, for Delhi and the NCR.', 'A number of families who have used our home care services now routinely refer patients to us which we consider a real vote of support. What also motivates us is the recognition that this work has aided our personal growth: we are more caring and considerate and thereby less likely to complain, judge others or find fault. But above all, we have discovered that happiness lies in sharing your time, effort and compassionate nature with another human being.', 'What a heart-warming thought this is! We urge our readers to come forward and lend a helping hand towards this poor and suffering section, while saluting the spirited teamwork of CanSupport.', 'The helpline number of CanSupport is: +91-11-26711212.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

But unlike its namesake in the Himalayas which is accessible only after an arduous trek, Kaas is at an easily motorable distance. Just 300 kms from Mumbai, and a mere 40 kms from Satara. It is this easy accessibility that’s the bane of Kaas.', 'And it is in this context that the conservation efforts of people like Dr. Sandeep Shrotri of Ranwata Society and Dr. Aparna Watwe, a well-known botanist and conservation activist, become extremely significant. Apart from getting Kaas included among the 39 World Natural Heritage Sites declared by UNESCO along the Western Ghats, they and their committed team are working day in and day out to conserve Kaas, and to sensitize the visitors and the villagers.', 'The Western Ghats is 1600 kms long, runs through 6 states from Gujarat to the peninsular tip of India, and is considered by geologists to be older than the Himalayas. It’s home to over 5,000 flowering plants, of which over 850 are found in Kaas alone, making it a botanist’s delight and a nature lover’s paradise.', 'A report from Centre Terre had this observation to make about the ecological value of this biosphere:', '‘This mountain-range is one of India’s hottest hotspots of bio-diversity, and was the focus of intense debate at the 36th Session of the World Heritage Committee consisting of the 21 member states of UNESCO. At the end of the debate, the Committee of the World Heritage Convention of UNESCO agreed to inscribe 39 sites along the Western Ghats as World Natural Heritage Sites of outstanding universal value.', 'The meeting of the ministers and the government representatives of 189 member states of UNESCO gave a loud applause after the decision of the Committee for the excellent work done by the Indian delegation who put forward a convincing argument for the inscription, in the face of an unfavorable recommendation from International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), an advisory body of UNESCO. It is the first time that India has succeeded in getting serial nomination for World Heritage Sites in cultural or natural or mixed category.’', 'Here’s an excerpt from a note on Kaas compiled by the Biome Conservation Foundation:', '‘A specialty of this plateau is the abundance of carnivorous plants: Utricularia and Drosera. Along with this, many rare ground orchids, Eriocaulons, grasses, algae, mosses and ferns are also seen here. This habitat supports diverse animals including insects, fish, frogs, lizards and geckos, snakes and rodents. Malabar larks, pipits and raptors such as eagles and kestrels are very frequently seen on the Kaas plateau.', 'The vegetation on the plateau is mostly seasonal and grows in monsoon. Plants on Kaas plateau show distinct temporal changes with the onset and progress of monsoon. The peak of flowering occurs in September. However these species remain in dormant condition in this area throughout the dry months.', 'As seen from this, Kaas plateau is a unique representative plateau habitat of Northern Western Ghats and needs to be protected for its floristic and ecological characters. Biotic influence on the plateau was restricted to local grazing activities so far. But in recent years, there is heavy growth in the number of tourists attracted by the scenic beauty of the flower-clad plateau and the lake.', 'Increase in trampling, and littering caused by tourists will have a very serious negative impact on the highly sensitive plant communities on the plateau. The adjoining plateau of Panchgani table land is totally destroyed by tourism. It is therefore necessary to take immediate protection measures for the conservation of this area which has recently been declared as World Heritage Site.’', 'The environmental activists, through sheer tenacity, and with unstinted support from the Forest Department, have succeeded in getting many of their demands met, though they are being implemented in phases.', 'And sensitizing visitors to a list of definite Don’ts:', 'Dr. Aparna Watwe shared this note when I asked her about the team behind this laudable conservation effort:', '‘Mr. Praveen Gowda, Deputy Conservator of Forests, has been managing the conservation efforts on ground since last year. He has really given his best, working closely with JFMC and other NGOs. He has implemented many suggestions made by researchers, and he deserves special praise for taking in these inputs. Mr. Hulle, who was RFO of this area last year, was also very keen on the preservation of this habitat and truly led the team efforts.', 'But the real heroes of Kaas are the 20-odd members of the Joint Forest Management Committee from the four adjoining villages. I can only imagine the hardships they face on Kaas, standing there in the rain and the sun. It’s a shame that most tourists are extremely rude to them. In fact, none of the tourists realize that round the clock these volunteers are collecting the trash left by them, as well as preventing them from trampling on the flowers. This is something they have voluntarily taken up since the last two years. Of course they are paid daily wages, but their motivation is much deeper than economic gains alone.', 'Another person working quietly is Prerna Agarwal, a researcher from Pune. She has been studying the impact of tourism on Kaas vegetation, and finding novel solutions for the emerging problems. Since June 2012, she and her team of college students have been constantly monitoring vegetation, tourist movement, attitudes, and waste problems. They keep giving management suggestions to the field team, based on their research. Under her guidance, Apeksha Patil studied waste removal and disposal, and together they have evolved a system that drastically reduces the impact on the ecosystem. Social and ecological surveys were also conducted by Yatish Lele from Prerna’s team, and he is currently working out the future management options for the region.', 'I have mentioned just a few names, but there are so many who are working namelessly.

9,2013-10,"['Archives', 'TBI Social Enterprise: Green Leaf Energy – A Sapling That Brought A Sea Of Change!']","['Some stories, some people, some initiatives, make the passersby pause and take note. These are stories of courage, of passion, of change and of unparalleled determination. Kumar Ankit, an alumnus of XLRI Jamshedpur, is an epitome of all that a social entrepreneur needs to be. He is all of 25, but the milestones which he has achieved are not just remarkable but awe-inspiring too.', 'Ankit, a native of Bihar, had grown up seeing rampant poverty around him. He used to feel troubled by the helplessness of the innumerable people in his state and hence started nurturing a dream – a dream to be able to make a difference to the society. He started early and as a young engineering student, the aspirations he had were very different from that of a regular college-goer. While his peer group was busy ridiculing the government, Ankit was minutely reading the five year plans, reports of ministries and development policies. He was of the view, and rightly so, that the government has the largest resources and hence, the impact that one can have while working in tandem with the system can be far greater.', 'It was in the year 2008 that an idea struck him while he was reading through the National Bio-fuel Policy. It was a simple and obvious observation that the Government was putting concerted efforts in the procurement of alternate fuels. Ankit realized that “Pongamia pinnata” (bio-diesel producing plant) can be installed on wastelands, and the fact that Bihar has vast areas of wastelands which were rendered useless for farmers, may actually be utilized in the plantation of “Pongamia”. This idea he thought would solve a multitude of problems such as migration and unemployment, and would also empower the farmers to lead a life of dignity and financial independence.', 'Ankit knew that he had to invest in this idea; he knew that this is the venture which he had dreamed about; but he was young, raw and without any experience of running a business. He thought that an MBA degree would do him good and may even help him in furthering his interest in entrepreneurship. He chose the very renowned XLRI, Jamshedpur to pursue his MBA and with single-minded perseverance crystallized his dream into reality. Within no time, Green Leaf Energy Private Limited came into existence; it was under the aegis of XLRI Entrepreneurship Development Center and was mentored by Prof Prabal Sen and Prof Madhukar Shukla. Ankit, under the guidance of his professor,s started with a nursery in Kothwara near Gaya – the thought was to take the first step, replicate and then scale further.', 'While the initiative was still at a nascent stage, an amendment in NREGA came through under which it could be implemented on an individual farmer’s land. This in effect meant that Green Leaf could get support from the Government under the NREGA to cover material and labor costs for plantation activities. Ankit’s perseverance and encouragement from Professor Sen eventually led to the Government approving funds disbursement to the tune of Rs 26,700 per acre. This didn’t come on a platter – there were presentations to be made, bureaucracy to be dealt with, Government to be convinced, but it did happen. Ankit’s relentless pursuit paid off and the Bihar Government was on board to support the venture in its endeavor.', 'The model’s modus operandi was simple yet effective. Four families were given the responsibility of taking care of 200 samplings of Pongamia. Since MGNREGS guarantees 100 days of work but Pongamia blooms only in five years, the farmers kept earning throughout the period. To keep everyone interested, the payment is linked to survival of plants, 90% survival at 100% wages, 75% survival at 50% wages and below that nothing is paid. Ankit believes that post-gestation, a farmer can get up to Rs 20,000-25,000 per acre annually by selling the seeds to Green Leaf, which would then crush the seeds to extract bio-diesel, and, in turn, sell that to oil companies such as Bharat Petroleum. The company has already got joint venture offers from Indian Oil and BPCL to set up biodiesel value chain in Bihar.', 'In the first year of operations, though Ankit employed only 15 people in a full time capacity, he had led to employment of more than 2,000 farmers to work for his plantations. His project generated 15,000 man-days of labour under NREGS and more than Rs 18 lakh was disbursed as wages to the farmers.', 'Ankit was not alone in the arduous and ambitious goal of his. The expansion was fuelled both in spirit and size from the beginning. Three of his other batch mates from XLRI Jamshedpur – Diwakar Kaushik, Kshitij Datta Rishi and Kunal Gangwani left their cushy corporate jobs and joined him to grow the venture further.', 'Apart from biofuel, 2011 saw Green leaf promoting horticulture plantations such as mango, grapes, pomegranate and other fruits. This push for diversification came from both within the company and from the government officials of Bihar who wanted Ankit to work on the arable lands as well. With the Government’s support and a new and renewed enthusiasm to work with different species and people, the organization successfully planted 7 million saplings in 2012-13 leading to employment opportunities for 140,000 families across Bihar.', 'The idea for horticulture plants led the team to think about the completion of value chain as in the case of biofuel. This would provide a market to the various farmers working in the fields for horticulture plantations and remove any middlemen and directly transfer the profits to the communities working for maintaining the plants. For this, extensive research was carried out for identifying food processing opportunities in India. So as a forward linkage, the company is opening fresh fruit juice kiosks in and around NCR under the brand name of ‘Fruit Press’ due to start operations soon.', 'The overwhelming success in Bihar has led to the thought of replicating the model pan-India. When Ankit mentioned about the expansion pan-India, his booming voice had a sense of pride, achievement, fulfillment, all combined together.', 'The journey from a nursery to a successful alternate fuel generator and fruit processing organization has come with its own set of roadblocks but Ankit says “Let it Go, was never an option. You need to be consistent with your goal”. As much as he had to keep himself going, he had to comfort his parents that he would be successful in his venture. He had a year to prove himself and he did, in more ways than one.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
