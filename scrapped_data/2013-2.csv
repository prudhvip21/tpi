Once in a while, we’d also chance upon a picture of one of them in the act in the inside pages of local newspapers. If you ever, for a fleeting moment wondered how they did it, or what their lives were like, here’s the story of Mumbai’s Narayan Ramakrishnan, one of the top names in the league.', 'In the chaotic suburb of Andheri, Sri Ram Nagar society is an oasis. It is easy to find a world within this lush, all-Tamilian-Brahmin locality, and Ramakrishnan, or RK as he likes to call himself, hasn’t really lived out of the comfort zone he grew up in. His space is like any other old Bombay dwelling, until you spot some details – the nameplate outside saying ‘foot painter’ under his name, his balcony having been converted into an airy studio and most strikingly, the vast floor space for him to move freely on his wheelchair. Why, the home’s doors too have given away to arches. A Peanuts poster somewhere reads ‘There is no such thing as too many friends.’', 'We’re lucky to meet RK’s sibling Vimala, mother of two who’s currently in town from the Middle-East. So while RK wheels himself animatedly around the room, animating through his eyes, hands and of course feet, his elder sister (who calls him Ambi), unfolds his craft. “He never went to school, but that didn’t bother either of my parents who were both teachers! He was always the creative one, having begun by painting egg shells with his feet after an architect uncle suggested so,” she begins. RK was just days old when a vicious jaundice (due to an unusual blood incompatibility problem) rendered most motor controls over his fingers and toes useless, a condition later confirmed to be cerebral palsy.', 'With the his right foot (and its two ‘good toes’), RK began doing seemingly tough chores such as opening the main door, operating remote controls, handling money and gesturing frantically in arguments. “With no formal education – even the JJ School (of Arts) refused to admit him, he’s striven to learn his skills. We’d pay JJ students to come home and share their learnings for Rs 250 a week,” Vimala goes on, exchanging glances with him. With time, the man grew more adept and disciplined, and more importantly, it began showing in his paintings. The makeshift painting corner became ‘RK Studio’ and in 1990, he became the first Indian member of the International Mouth & Foot Painting Association, a global outfit that still sends him a more-than-sufficient stipend in Swiss Francs. IMFPA now has 15 foot and mouth painters from the country and most of them, besides earning royalties in occasional greeting card sales, earn the stipend and sell art works for a living.', '“His first exhibition was in ’92 and he’s had many since!” Vimala smiles, recalling an event when some city society celebs bought all of his works. The numbers range from 10,000 to 30,000 and more, and there must be more than sympathy in the motives of RK’s buyers’, we decide, looking at some of the pretty landscapes he’s hung in the drawing room.', 'At age 42 now, the foot painter is content in his cocoon – which comprises paints and oils, neighbourhood friends, constantly visiting relatives (Vimala is one of three sisters) and Mani, his part-time assistant. “He doesn’t mind being alone at all, in fact he’s happiest while creating something on his own,” Vimala says, though we note that RK cannot function without Mani putting a straw in his drinking water, helping him change and do the many small chores we take for granted. The companionship question for him was mulled over by the siblings, who even placed an ad in The Hindu, but destiny didn’t send across anyone significant.', 'Today, the confidence we see in the namesake of this tiny RK Studio is thanks to his parents, Vimala admits. “From regularly getting him the extra toy to being supportive in his passion, they did it all.” When their mother passed away and their father followed later, she feared he won’t take it well, but he showed unexpected bravado, she tells us, as we see RK raising a knee to wipe his tears.', 'Not a man to hide the many emotions and colours of his extraordinary life, RK can be found laughing with Mani over a beer on Sunday afternoons. Being surefooted sure has different meanings.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

This is ‘Jago Banaras’ – and it would be so easy to implement it in your city or neighbourhood as well!', 'Varanasi (Banaras), popularly known as Kashi among Hindus, is considered as the most sacred and holiest of Indian cities. It is said that death at Varanasi brings salvation to the soul. Banaras is also one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world. The city is a major tourist attraction for both Indians and foreigners. Kashi is known for its rich cultural heritage, temples and ghats. It is the home to one of the most sacred Jyotirlinga (a shrine where Lord Shiva is worshipped in the form of a “Lingam (pillar) of light”) for Hindus, the Kashi Vishwanath temple and is often called as Lord Vishwanath’s home. Besides, it is also an important seat of learning. Varanasi is the site of the highly prestigious and one of the largest residential universities of Asia, Banaras Hindu University.', 'With the advent of modernism, the state of the city has witnessed tremendous change. The city is struggling amidst garbage and filth. The holy Ganges, which flows through the city’s ghats is also getting impacted by high filth and pollution levels. It appears that it has become a dumping ground both for the tourists who visit the city as well as the residents. In such a scenario, ‘Jago Banaras’ is doing its bit to keep the city clean and pollution-free.', '‘Jago Banaras’ is an initiative started by the residents of Varanasi themselves. Hundreds of school children are part of the various campaigns under the initiative, which gives a greater visibility to the issues. The objective of the initiative is to draw the attention of the government authorities towards the pathetic condition of the roads with garbage scattered everywhere and other basic civic amenities including sanitation.', 'The initiative is a result of collaboration between Varanasi Vikas Samiti (VVS), a forum of local residents, and different schools and social and voluntary organisations in the city. The team at ‘Jago Banaras’ is using various social media channels to popularise the movement further. Local newspapers carry news on the initiative’s progress. Recently the team urged the residents of Varanasi to post/send images and videos of garbage and bad condition of the locality they live in or their surrounding areas. This was widely publicised through local and social media. The monitoring committee at ‘Jago Banaras’ planned to use these in the High Court as evidence. As a result, the team received a huge positive response from the people of the city as well as the frequent visitors. A large collection of photos, especially, video recordings of statements of citizens and affidavits of at least 40 different persons from different localities were put before the Hon’ble High Court with newspaper cuttings to show the reality that not much has been done by the local authorities to improve the state of the city.', 'As the fight for a cleaner Kashi still continues in the Court, the initiative is being received as a movement filled with hope and action for the residents of the city, who crave for fresh air and cleaner roads. By supporting ‘Jago Banaras’, we would be preserving the rich heritage as well as the environment that our ancestors passed on to us. In order to bring the desired change, the residents of the city and the tourists who visit this sacred place, should ensure to opt for more bio-degradable products and not to throw garbage such as plastic bottles and bags irresponsibly. The message is quite clear – It’s easy to go green- Reduce, Reuse and Recycle!', 'You could follow their activities on their Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/JagoBanaras', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

His passion for finding solutions to centuries-old problems and determination to carry on his work even in the face of\xa0resistance\xa0or lack of resources is an inspiration to all.', 'Mr Vidya Rattan Sharma, a familiar name in Solan District of Himachal Pradesh, started his life journey as a cook. He worked with Sutra NGO, then Social Work Research Centre (SWRC), for 5 years while cooking meals for their employees in Rajasthan. His concern as well as love for making innovative cookstoves started from that time onwards. On finding out his passion for cookstoves, Sutra appointed him for the task of training local people to make Nadda Chulha that was innovated by the organization. Little did he know that it was the perfect start to his future!', 'Since 1991, his journey as a Founder Director of Society for Development and Environment Protection (DEEP) has been full of challenges. Most of the problems that he faced came because of his low education background and lack of funds. There came times when he remained the only employee of DEEP Santhan, still he kept going with all his energy and determination. The result, today, is a number of successful products and programs in cookstoves, organic farming, traditional medicine and animal husbandry. Many of his techniques and programs have been adopted by governments of multiple states.', 'His most cherished innovation is the Modern DEEP Chulha that helps the users to not only improve fuel efficiency by as much as 50% but also boil water for bathing and cleaning purposes with the help of tanks placed on the sides of its walls.', 'I came up with the final version of the Chulha in 1995. This innovation has helped people in my region to reduce smoke in their kitchens. Earlier there used to be a lot of health problems, especially with women and children, due to smoke. Now the breathing-related health complaints have come down. In addition, now women don’t have to heat up water separately every morning and carry the same to bathrooms for bathing. I set water pipelines in a manner that my people can now enjoy hot-water showers in their bathrooms only. I always wanted to come up with a modern solution to this problem as I believe we villagers have equal right to live our lives in fashionable ways.', 'explains Mr Sharma with a content look. In addition to this chulha, he has also worked in animal husbandry, traditional medicine and organic farming field. His course module for training village women for animal healthcare was adopted by Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh Governments. He also wrote 12 books on ‘Sutra for animal-keeping and healthcare’ during that time.', 'In the last 21 years, DEEP Santhan has created laudable impact by working with more than 35,000 people in 180 villages of Solan and Shimla District of Himachal Pradesh. “We have installed more than 1000 chulhas in the last 17 years. We now wish to expand the reach of the product by training people across the country to manufacture it themselves. We believe in keeping our innovation as ‘Open Source’ so that maximum people can earn livelihood and benefit from the same. We are looking for funds to set up a training center here in Solan district.”', 'Talking about the product demand, Mr Sharma says, “We are sure we can crack the market as our product attracts customers. In the past 17 years, people have come forward with their requirements and in some cases we guided them to make the product themselves as we lacked resources. Our chulha has been widely supported by ‘State Council for Science, Technology and Environment, Himachal Pradesh’ and numerous village Panchayats.”', 'As of now, Mr Sharma is working with HelpAge India to serve elder people in his area. He has formed 34 elders’ Self Help Groups (eSHG) and is constantly looking out for ways to improve their situation. “Our collaboration with HelpAge India dates back to 1996 when I wanted to create income generation opportunities for 60 local elders by making Charcoal, Dhoop and Agarbatti from Lantana. Since then, the organization kept supporting us and today we have reached a group of 710 Elders.”', 'Mr Sharma is a keen observer who loves to find different ways to solve local problems. He has invented technologies for drying pulses without losing nutritional content in sunlight, growing mushrooms with more output in regions where climate is non-supportive and harvesting rainwater by constructing low cost and algae restraining concrete block tanks. He received the ‘Rising personalities of India’ award from Friendship Forum of India in 2002 for his outstanding innovations.', 'Students from development sector love to intern in his organization and learn from his vast knowledge and experience. Mr Sharma recently concluded an intensive three week training program for students from DA-IICT College in Gandhinagar. The training program helped students to understand the benefits of using traditional medicines, communicate the benefits of improved biomass cookstoves by public demonstration, work on the fields for the first time and understand the requirements of the villagers through on-field surveys.', '“We love to have such students with us who are ready to work on the field. We have been getting interns for a long time now. We would in fact welcome more universities to send their students to our organization. This also helps us to get fresh outlook on our activities”, he concluded.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

After all, travelling in a rocking boat over the temperamental River Brahmaputra and then treading through a dense forest to reach a health facility is not for the faint hearted. Not surprising then that most women would avoid regular prenatal and antenatal check ups, preferring to leave everything to fate.', 'It was the launch of the boat clinic services in 2005 that turned things around for them. An initiative of the Centre for North East Studies (C-NES), the boats bring healthcare to the doorstep of the most vulnerable communities living in the state’s river islands, or ‘saporis’, where access to hospitals is a far cry, and communication, a challenge.', 'Some three million people, or 12 per cent of the state’s population, live on the 2,500 islands on the Brahmaputra. Most villages here get completely cut off from the mainland during the floods. What makes this initiative even more critical is the high maternal mortality ratio (MMR, or maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) in Assam. Its MMR level at 390 is one of the country’s highest.', 'Arumoni Regon, 55, of Laika village is a strong supporter of the boat clinics. She and her husband are among the most respected members of the community and people often come to them for advice on different matters. Recalls Regon, “Earlier, it was not easy for pregnant women to go for check-ups to the doctor. During floods they would have to take great risk to cross the river and then walk through the dense forests to reach the health centre.”', 'What this meant was that pregnant women would be reluctant to get regular check-ups and often gave birth at home. “It was not uncommon to hear of mothers dying during childbirth or babies not surviving. This is why I think the boat clinics are a blessing for us. I insist that everyone, especially pregnant women, avail the services that come to us,” adds Regon.', 'The journey of these boat clinics, or ‘ships of hope’, as they are popularly known, began with a single boat called Akha (Assamese for ‘hope’) in the Dibrugarh district of upper Assam. In 2004, when the concept of a boat health centre was showcased by C-NES, it won an award at the World Bank’s India Development Marketplace Awards. With the award money, construction of Akha started. Carpenters from Tinsukia and neighbouring areas worked for months readying the boat that finally sailed in June 2005.', 'This intervention got the attention and support of the district health authorities, the UNICEF as well as the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), which resulted in a successful public-private-partnership (PPP) and the subsequent spread of the programme to 13 districts of Assam. Besides Akha, today there are 15 other boats that provide basic medicines, organise medical camps and immunise children regularly.', 'Apart from immunisation programmes, family planning services are also being offered by the boat clinic team, with support from the Population Foundation of India (PFI). Five boat clinics have family planning counselors who meet and counsel eligible couples. Spacing between children is stressed upon. Says Mehebub Alam Hazarika, district programme officer of the Dhubri district, “People in these sapori areas are conservative. They resist permanent family planning methods; so we encourage them to use condoms and oral pills. Inviting resource persons from within the community to generate awareness on contraceptive care also helps a lot.”', 'According to C-NES 2010-11 annual report, a total of 58,945 people adopted family planning methods during the various health camps organised. Between October 2009 and July 2012, 1,032 women have been sterilised in Dhubri alone, while 121 women opted for intra-uterine device (IUD) and 15 men for vasectomy.', 'Every boat clinic has a 16-member team, including two doctors, a general nurse-cum-midwife (GNM), Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) and laboratory technician. They all work with the assistance of a community outreach person. The clinic has an OPD, a pharmacy and even a laboratory for blood and other tests. According to Bhaswati Goswami, communication officer at C-NES:', 'The main focus of the boat clinics is women and children. In the districts that we reach out to, most people have never seen a doctor, a stethoscope or a syringe in their lives. At a health camp in Dhemaji (lower Assam), the health team was elated to know that the child of the first woman who was under their prenatal supervision was named ‘Doctor’! That shows how much the team’s efforts are being appreciated.', 'Each boat clinic times its visits in accordance with the immunisation schedule of children, and pre- and ante-natal check up of women. The Accredited Social Health Activists or ASHAs are given advance information so that they can spread the word. Nafisa Begum, a young pregnant woman, was one of the many who waited along with her sister-in-law, Sakina, a young mother of one, in queue for her check-up when the boat clinic visited Baleswar village island in Nalbari district. “When my sister-in-law’s first child was born, she became so weak, we thought she would die. The child too was very tiny and died within the first week of birth. The ‘doctor’ (that’s how the locals refer to the ANM) told us later that she was anaemic. I don’t want the same thing to happen to me, so I make it a point to visit whenever the clinic comes,” she says.', 'Sanjoy Hazarika, the managing trustee of C-NES and the brain behind the concept, feels that he has nearly achieved his goal. In an interview towards the end of 2012 he said, “When I set out, my aim was to reach 10 lakh people by the end of 2012 and we will be nearing that goal. We have covered 70-75 per cent chars (islands) in the Dhubri district.” For Hazarika, winning people’s trust has also been a high point of the programme, “They know that after each visit we will return. Once the people have faith in you, they are open to new ideas, and that will lead them to exercising their rights.”', 'It has, however, not been easy convincing people. According to Minhazuddin Ahmed, a young doctor on a boat clinic, initially people were hesitant to allow their women to be checked by male doctors:', 'But a sustained effort has helped fight those reservations and now people call us to visit their village for a health camp. We are doing more than just treating people; we are also educating people, fighting superstitious beliefs, and offering hope.', 'Impressed by this work, the Union Health ministry has expressed interest in expanding the initiative in two or three other northeastern states. Reveals Hazarika, “We are also going to launch a hospital ship that will have an operation theatre, recovery room and wards, just like a Primary Health Centre (PHC) – but on water.” Funded by the North Eastern Council, the hospital ship is expected to become operational in another year or two, and will travel from one district to another.', 'Today, the boat clinics are making a real difference to the lives of Assamese women like Phaguni Payeng, 25, of Karmi Chuk sapori in Dibrugarh. Married to a daily wage earner, this mother of four lived in constant dread of yet another pregnancy until a neighbour told her about the clinic. The health team has provided Payeng not just with iron tablets but made her aware of family planning methods.', 'The prospect of better health remains afloat in this once-forgotten corner of Assam.', 'Read more about Assam’s boat clinics in a previous article here.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Here’s a look at how they landed in India, and managed to flourish while creating a deep respect and adoration in the hearts of Indians. Gangadharan Menon has interacted with his several Parsi friends and traveled to their historically important sites to recreate their history in words and photographs.', 'By the end of the 7th century, the mighty Sassanian Empire had been vanquished by Arab invaders. Many people of the Zoroastrian faith were consequently killed. Those who survived fled to the mountains of Iran. They were hounded out from there too, and after a brief respite in the town of Hormuz, they set sail for the friendly shores of India.', 'The ship that carried them was soon enveloped in a massive storm. The ship was rocked but not their faith. They prayed till the storm passed. And suddenly they discovered that they were washed ashore on the welcome shores of Nargol in Gujarat.', 'Legend has it that their leader, a Dastur, or a Parsi Priest, led his people to the durbar of the king of Sanjan named Jadhav Rana. When the Dastur requested permission for his people to settle down in Sanjan, the king asked for an empty vessel and some milk. Then, in full view of all those present, poured the milk into the vessel till it was full to the brim. And gave it to the Dastur, as if to mean that there is no place in the kingdom to accommodate Dastur’s people. The Dastur took the vessel of milk in his hand, sprinkled sugar into it, gave it back to the king, and smiled. The vessel didn’t spill over but had become sweeter! The king was so impressed with this brilliant metaphor that he gave them permission to settle down in Sanjan. And thus began one of the greatest integrations of two communities ever witnessed in the world.', 'At Nargol, where the Parsis first landed, I found a cluster of white-washed walls enclosing beautiful heritage houses, mostly manned by caretakers. After a lazy walk along its sleepy lanes, I found four kilometres of virgin beach with endless casuarinas whispering the tales of bygone era. And as I left my footprints on the white sands, I realized this beach is almost unaware of its own existence.', 'A few years after settling down in Sanjan, the Parsis requested the king to allow them to build a Fire Temple. The Sacred Fire, according to their religion, is the Son of Ahura Mazda, or the Eternal Light. And this Fire is made out of 16 fires. 15 of them come from earthly sources like a brick-maker’s kiln, a goldsmith’s fire, a baker’s oven, a shepherd’s house, a crematorium, a king’s house etc. The 16th fire is from a fire caused by lightning that comes from the heaven. The consecrated fire then occupies pride of place in the sanctum sanctorum of a Fire Temple. It took three years to purify this fire, and after it was placed in the Sanjan temple, it burned bright for 669 years, till the Mughals under Sultan Mahmud attacked Sanjan in the 13thcentury. The Parsis who had laid down their arms picked them up again. And 1400 valiant warriors under Ardeshir fought alongside the king’s army. The Mughals defeated them after a bitter battle. Fearing the kind of persecution which their forefathers had suffered at Arab hands, the Parsis fled to the mountains of Bahrot, 20 kms away. With the most valuable possession of them all: the Sacred Fire.', 'The journey of the Sacred Fire shows the supreme will power and the sagacious nature of this community. It was hidden in the caves of Bahrot for 12 years, then taken to the jungles of Vansda for 14 years, then it remained safe in Navsari for 313 years, 3 years in Surat, back in Navsari for 5 years, then in Valsad for 1 year, till it reached Udvada in 1742. Here, at Ground Zero of Parsis the world over, this sublime fire has been burning bright for 270 years at the Fire Temple of Iranshah Atash Behram.', 'Though they number just 60,000 in a population of 1.2 billion, some of the finest Indians have come from this miniscule community: lawyers and jurists, doctors, army officers, writers, and industrialists. Philanthropy runs in their veins and the greatest charitable trusts are run by them. And they not only take care of their elderly, but have built their Old Homes in the finest of locations in and around Mumbai: Matheran, Lonavla and Mahabaleshwar. And of all communities, they have the deepest concern about preserving nature and wildlife.', 'At Sanjan, there is no trace of the original Fire Temple, nor are there any quaint Parsi houses. There is only a commemorative pillar that was built a century ago, to mark the place of arrival of the Parsis in India.', 'Drive along the sea from Udvada and you will reach the twin beaches of Bordi and Gholvad. Known as the chikoo bowl of Maharashtra, they offer some fine Parsi cuisine too. Gool Khush is the pick of the Parsi restaurants offering you the best of class. Walk as much as you can on the deserted beach that stretches all of 17 kms, yes 17 kms! And once you have worked up a large appetite, feast on lagan-nu-bhonu, sali boti, dhansak , kheema-pao, dal-pulao, patra-ni-machchi, and top it all up with caramel custard. Or if you prefer, walk along the patchwork of light and shade in a shaded chikoo orchard nearby, and take a deep breath. The aroma of toffee you get comes from the resin of the chikoo trees, and can serve as an apt dessert.', 'Close by is the picturesque Asavli Dam, built painstakingly by hand, stone upon stone, much like how the pyramids were made. The dam has a mosaic of paddy fields on one side and the tranquil blue waters on the other side, encircling the yonder mountains like water snakes. Up among those hills of Bharda are the Bahrot Caves where the Parsis kept their holy fire safe and burning for 12 long years.', 'Yes, the Parsis have survived against many odds and have done wonderfully well in the land that adopted them. They have indeed been the sugar that for centuries has sweetened the flavour of the Indian ethos.', 'It is believed that Prophet Zarathusthra, unlike other mortal kids, laughed when he was born. Probably, looking at the way the Parsis have integrated so well into this country, he would be smiling now.', 'Gangadharan Menon is a nature writer, art teacher, and photographer of the wild.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

He paid for his doggedness in many ways, but that did not weaken his spirit or resolve. With no personal wealth or aspirations, he died in penury. But Nawab Rajendran’s legacy remains for all to admire and emulate!\xa0Read about the life of a great man.', 'These are the days of activism, and we are coming across a number of activists working in different fields. The Right to Information Act has emerged as a powerful tool for many such activists, and Non-Governmental organizations are making use of this new Act to promote their aims and causes. Various social networking sites are also doing good work in this area. With the increased popularity of such sites, passing information has been made easy.', 'When the media is biased, such sites help to bring out many secret deals and unholy practices being followed in the corridors of powers. All these developments have come about in the last decade, though corruptions and malpractices by the rulers were there even before. At a time, when obtaining information from a government department was difficult, and when publicizing the same was even more difficult, there was a person who crossed all the barriers that stood in his way and fought against the arrogant rulers and their cohorts till his last breath. All he had was the support and unconditional love of the common man who saw a savior in him. He never tried to benefit from the confidence put in him by the people. He lived a life of ultimate simplicity, but with a mind that was always thinking of new ideas to fight the evils in our society.', 'T.A. Rajendran, born in the small town of Payyannur in the Kannur District of Kerala, started his career as a journalist. After a short span of working as a journalist, he started a mid-day daily in Trichur, in the name and style of Nawab. Everyday, some or the other news about corruption in the government departments were brought out through this publication. It earned him a lot of enemies and the anger spewed by the influential people caused him his publication. He had to close it forever. Though the Nawab daily has closed, the name did not leave him. He became popular as Nawab Rajendran.', 'After closing the daily, he adopted public interest litigation as a tool to fight the evils of the society. He has filed a number of cases under this provision and most of them were against the former chief minister and a powerful politician of his time Late Mr. K. Karunakaran.', 'His biography clearly outlines various cases which he had filed against many political leaders, and claims that he had the custody of various incriminating documents, which would have put an end to the career of many political leaders in Kerala. In it, he says that the then DIG of Crime Branch Mr. Jayaram Padikkal had taken all the documents from him under the instruction of K. Karunakaran. He had to suffer a lot during the efforts of the police in collecting those records. He had great difficulty in opening his mouth because of the damage caused by the police who plucked his teeth ruthlessly in their mission to take the documents. He had undergone many atrocities during his time under police custody too. As Rajendran claims, Padikkal has repented about this action later.', 'Though the most number of cases he had filed were against K.Karunakaran, there was one single case which shot him to fame. The then irrigation minister, who was undergoing an enquiry about some misdeeds in the purchase of pipes for irrigation purpose, arranged his daughter’s marriage. The girl was still a minor. At a time when there was no Right to Information Act to help in gathering information, Rajendran took great pain in collecting the necessary documents and filed a case against the minister. This case was proved to be right prima facie and the minister had to resign after a comment form the High Court.', 'After this incident the government approached the High Court of Kerala to denounce Nawab Rajendran as an annoying litigant, as he approached the court with a large number of cases thus wasting the valuable time of the court. However, the honorable High Court of Kerala rejected this plea, stating that a good number of cases filed by Nawab have been won by him and the society requires certain people like him who will work as corrective forces against corrupt practices.', 'Though he was born in Kannur and later shifted to Trichur his main area of action was Kochi city where the High Court of Kerala is located. Though he was very famous, he was a pauper and the only wealth he had was a pair of worn clothes and an old-style spectacle with thick black frames. He never stayed at a place for a long time. He was always on tour searching for evidences to support his case or to find out new issues. Still he had a unique postal address. It was, Nawab Rajendran, High Court Verandah, Kochi. It may sound funny, but the fact is that he never missed a letter posted to this address. Though we all have a lot of complaints about the postal department, the people in the department were punctual as far as the letters for Nawab was concerned.', 'When he was at Kochi, he used to stay at the students’ hostel of Government Law College. The students of that time and other youngsters regarded him as a leader. They were ready to support him in all ways. They provided him shelter in their hostel rooms, shared their food with him and even gave him spare change for his daily intake of energy drinks. If he was not able to stay in the hostel due to various reasons, his next shelter was the Bus Stand. During my college days, I used to see him regularly. Most of the time, he used to travel by foot. Sometimes he would accept a ride on the two-wheelers of some of his friends. For long journeys he depended upon lorry services. The students, journalists, drivers and many people belonging to the middle and lower strata of the society were behind him. However he was never interested in using that popularity and confidence for his own benefits.', 'There is an Indian Coffee House in the heart of Kochi city, very near to Maharaja’s College. It had a reputation of being a meeting joint for intellectuals and students who had leftist thoughts. The evenings there were always filled with many discussions and debates among small groups. Nawab was a regular visitor there too. Once I asked him about starting an organized movement against the evils of the society. His reply really surprised me.', 'There is no need to organize movements. Organization will certainly end in more corruption as an organization needs a lot of funds to run the show. And we will have to depend on rich people for that. As a result, we will have to do favors for them. If anybody wants to join me, let him do the work on his own. If everyone is ready to fight the evil practices of the society then all such nasty things will disappear.', 'Thus he continued his crusade against the wrongs in the society. Corruption was his major area of interest; though he brought a number of other evils also out and fought against them. He has been received recognition for his efforts by many private institutions.', 'In the 1990’s, he was awarded Rupees Two Lakh by a Trust for his outstanding services to the society. He took just Rupees Thousand from it, and donated the rest for constructing a state-of-the-art mortuary in the Kochi General Hospital. This proved that money was not an important consideration in his life. Fighting with the malicious practices and with the malicious tumour which was eating him slowly, he breathed his last breath on 10th October 2003. His last wish was to donate his body for medical studies. However, it was claimed that the government cremated his body in a hurried manner. The government received a lot of criticism over this incident. Thus even by his death he succeeded in exposing the political class!', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
6,2013-2,"['Archives', 'Weaving Values Into Teaching: The VITAL Approach']","['\n\n\nby\n\nYoginder Sikand\n\n\nFebruary 8, 2013, 10:39 am \n\n\n', 'It seems to be a widely-shared lament that with the rapid spread of modern education, time-honoured values are quickly disappearing from our personal and collective lives. This may not be a mere coincidence because modern education focuses mainly on the cognitive or intellectual development of children, paying relatively little attention to nurturing their affective or emotional intelligence. VITAL is an initiative that aims at making value education an integral part of a student’s life, with an interesting model for teachers to adopt.', 'Various efforts have been made in the past to promote value education in schools. The results of these have been mixed. Overall, they have not been able to stem the perceived erosion of values in society. Some schools teach ‘Moral Science’ or ‘Life Skills’ or ‘Civics’, packaged as a separate subject, but, in many cases, neither teachers nor students take the subject very seriously. It is often regarded as an extra frill, a ‘subsidiary’, an add-on, and as simply an unavoidable burden. It languishes at the periphery of the curriculum. Teaching values in this\xa0compartmentalised\xa0way has been found to be rather ineffective, and sometimes the entire exercise is generally reduced to sanctimonious preaching.', 'Governmental authorities seem to have woken up to the magnitude and scale of our moral decline, recognizing the role that education can play to help remedy matters in this regard. In October 2012, the Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry requested the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) to resume moral and value-based education at the elementary school level. In the same month, the Union Human Resource Development Minister announced plans to focus on moral education in order to promote positive values among the country’s youth. In December 2012, provoked by a massive agitation in the wake of a rape of a girl in Delhi, the Prime Minister’s Office directed the Human Resource Development Ministry to give greater stress on promoting value education in schools.', 'Recognising both the lack of effective value education in schools as well as the importance of it, in late 2012 a group of volunteers at Anandashram, a charitable organization based in Kanhangad, Kerala, launched an innovative initiative, called VITAL — which stands for Value-Integrated Teaching and Learning. VITAL seeks to make value education an integral part of the existing school curriculum without requiring it to be treated as a separate subject. Recognizing that the curriculum is already so tightly packed that many schools might not have the time for an additional time-slot for value education, VITAL proposes a simple solution — teachers of various subjects can extrapolate key positive values from their daily classroom lessons and relay to their students a short value-based message to enable the latter to draw lessons from them that are related to their own lives. In this way, students can be inspired, a VITAL volunteer explains, to move from ‘Me to We’, to realise and respect the inter-dependence of all forms of life, including their own.', 'Methodology\nVITAL sees itself as an experiment in trying to weave into the teaching process the more than 80 positive values that the NCERT has suggested be made a core component of school education. The unique feature of the VITAL approach is that it does not require teaching values as a separate subject. Instead, it seeks to integrate value education into the existing curriculum. This it does by identifying one or the other of the 80 values highlighted by the NCERT in each lesson or chapter in school textbooks, which teachers can convey to their students in the form of a value-based message as part of their regular classroom instruction.', 'This message is to be crafted in such a way that it resonates with the students’ own lives and experiences. To make sure that this does not interfere with the main teaching work or distract students from ongoing class instruction, conveying and reflecting on the short value-based message is to be limited to just a minute or two. This may not be sufficient for a detailed discussion with students but it is likely that even a short, crisp message of this sort, sent out in every class, will have an indelible positive impact on the students’ minds, attitudes and behaviour. This can go a long way in helping students become more appreciative of their inter-connectedness with all beings, animate as well as inanimate, and kindling, in a non-obtrusive and non-invasive manner, their innate humanity. It can also help make the teachers become more aware of the links they can draw between academics and ethics, between their lectures and key moral values, so that their work can contribute to the emotional, in addition to the intellectual, nurturing of their students, rather than remaining simply an academic exercise.', 'Identifying Values From Textbooks\nCurrently, the VITAL team is working on identifying key values and value-based lessons that can be culled out from chapters in textbooks that are recommended by various educational boards. This effort is being supplemented with inputs provided by a number of school teachers and trainee teachers with whom the VITAL team has been interacting over the last several months through discussions and workshops in various places in Karnataka and Kerala.', 'The VITAL team plans to host the material that it is generating on an Internet portal so that teachers and others across the country can freely access and use it. Of course, the values and value-based messages that the VITAL team has drawn from chapters in various textbooks are not the only ones that can be extracted from the same material. Teachers may be able to derive other values and value-based messages from the same texts, although they are free to use the ideas developed by the VITAL team if they want.', 'VITAL Methodology: Some Examples\nAs mentioned above, the VITAL team has identified a number of values in various chapters in textbooks used at different levels that can be made the subject of a brief value-based message each time a teacher takes a class. It may appear that while drawing values from textbooks for the social sciences and humanities is not difficult, this may not be the case with textbooks used for subjects like Mathematics and the ‘hard sciences’. But this is not really so. Even in these subjects, it is possible to imaginatively draw out key values and send out positive value-based messages to students.', 'Below are some examples to illustrate how lessons in textbooks for every subject provide ample scope for values to be identified and for value-based messages to be developed and conveyed to students.', 'When a Biology textbook talks of the caterpillar’s struggle, starting from its being wrapped up in a cocoon until it finally turns into a butterfly, one value that the teacher can extrapolate from this and embody in a value-based message is of the need for determined effort for success in life. In a lesson on plant germination, the teacher can identify ‘helpfulness’ as a value, asking her students to reflect on the parallels between the sun, water, soil and the air all helping the seed to turn into a plant and the help rendered by different people to an individual to enable him to develop his latent potential. In a chapter on osmosis, which talks about water passing from a region of high-water concentration through a semi-permeable membrane to a region of low-water concentration, the teacher can identify ‘empathy’ as a value and suggest that the rich can share some of their wealth or other possessions with the poor.', 'When a Physics book discusses how magnets attract iron filings, the teacher can identify ‘attraction’ as a positive value in human affairs, and ask her students to reflect on the similarities between a magnet and a person with positive qualities to whom others are instinctively drawn. In a lesson that deals with capacitators that store electric charge and release it when necessary, the teacher can identify ‘planning for the future’ as a value and say a few sentences about a new savings’ scheme to help parents save for their children’s higher education.', 'When a Chemistry textbook deals with the bonding of chemicals to form a new substance, the teacher could identify ‘bonding’ or ‘cooperation’ as the key value and mention in passing how cooperative team-work among human beings is necessary for their collective welfare.', 'When a Mathematics lesson discusses parallel lines, the teacher can draw out a value-based lesson by remarking that just as two parallel lines never meet but, yet, run smoothly while facing each other, so, too, in life one comes across people who think very differently from oneself, and one can learn to accept them and to live harmoniously with them. In a lesson on circles, the teacher can point out that just as every point on the circumference of a circle is equidistant from the circle’s centre, so, too, in a democracy everyone is, at least theoretically, equal. Or, she could mention that just as from the centre of the circle one can get a 360 degree view all around, so, too, when considering doing something important it is helpful to have a complete, or 360 degree, perspective on it by properly weighing all the pros and cons of the matter.', 'In a chapter in an English grammar textbook that relates the story of a monkey cleverly managing to escape from a crocodile by using his presence of mind, the teacher could identify ‘mindfulness’ as a key value and say a few words about how, through mindfulness, one can effectively meet various difficult situations in life. From an essay that describes an army of ants greeting each other by touching each other’s feelers, the teacher could identify ‘courtesy’ and ‘friendliness’ as important values and mention how important it is to acknowledge and greet others, including strangers, even if with just a smile. A story about birds spending much of the day foraging for food can be used as an opportunity by the teacher to raise the importance of perseverance as a value. From a story about a camel trudging through the desert the teacher can raise ‘bravery’ and ‘courage’ as key values and reflect on how it is that in challenging situations that we are forced to be brave and bring out the best in us. The desert could also be seen as signifying a positive value, just as the camel can. Deserts, the teacher can say, have their own purpose in Nature’s plan and are beautiful as well as useful in their own way. Likewise, the teacher can add, a manual worker is to be respected in the same way as anyone else, for he, too, plays an important role in society.', 'Ideally, every lesson in textbooks used for every subject and at every level should be able to generate values and value-based messages such as these. All that needs to be done is for the teacher to identify just one such value from every lesson and construct and send out a single such value-based message in every class she takes. In this way, students will receive a positive value-based message in every period that they attend, throughout the academic year.', 'Reaching Out\nThe VITAL team has been closely interacting with a number of schools and teachers’ training colleges in Kerala and Karnataka to develop and further refine its methodology as well as to popularize its approach to value education. For this approach to be actually put into practice in the classroom on a large scale, relevant government ministries, educational boards, the management of educational institutions and the media need to be convinced of its usefulness and efficacy.', 'The VITAL approach can be freely used and developed by anyone concerned about value education in schools. It does not belong to the VITAL team alone, and so if found useful by others, the VITAL team would be glad if they adopt it.', 'For more information about VITAL, contact vital4education@gmail.com', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

At least, in economic terms they are very much alike, according to Rupa Subramanya and Vivek Dehejia, as they explain further in their new book, Indianomix: Making Sense Of Modern India.', 'This is where you will find explanations to a lot of peculiarities about India that you might have wondered about or puzzled over. Such as, why do people cross railway tracks when so many of them lose their lives on it every year? Is democracy better for India, or can an authoritarian regime propel it on the path of bonanza growth?
