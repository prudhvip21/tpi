About charity. Many of us donate whenever we can to charities of our choice, whatever amount we can. That amount could help a child get an year’s education, clothes, etc. but the problem is donations like these are sporadic and intermittent. NGOs have to wait for funds and in the meanwhile have to keep their projects on hold.', 'To counter problems like these, Charities Aid Foundation (CAF India) has launched the 100 Rupee Club , India’s smallest social change funding initiative. Through a monthly commitment of Rs. 100 for 12 months, an individual can support CAF India’s social change fund. This initiative is specifically designed to develop strategic investment for achieving high and long term impact from social development projects.', 'Through 100 Rupee Club, one can support three thematic areas of livelihood promotion, education and health for greater impact. Objectives of the thematic areas are :', '100 Rupee Club is an effort wherein an individual partners with not just one but three Non profits for a longer term. One feels part of the inclusive growth that is happening vis-a-vis the development projects being undertaken by the non profits.', 'In other words, 100 Rupee Club is like a mutual fund of ‘giving’.', 'Site : http://donate.cafindia.org/memberships/100RupeeClub', 'Writer, Researcher interested in social enterprise, innovation, culture and networks.

The village with the highest GDP in the country.', 'Ensconced in the rain shadow area of the Sahyadari range , Hiware Bazar faced an acute water crisis and severe land degradation during the 1970s.', 'Throughout the 1980s, the village had a rain fed farming situation which resulted in limited seasonal agriculture and forced the farmers to migrate to surrounding towns and cities for work. The village therefore was deprived of its sole source of income – agriculture and the inhabitants turned to local liquor production and selling, giving rise to criminal activities.', 'Driven by a desire to improve the condition of the village, Popatrao Baguji Pawar came back to the village from Ahmednagar. In 1990, he won the elections and became the sarpanch. From there began the transformation of Hiware Bazar.', 'A five pronged approach has been adopted for the socio-economic infrastructure of the village that includes :', 'Shramdan has inculcated a work culture among the local people, making Hiware Bazar a model for community development. Ban of grazing & cutting trees has tremendously increased the production of grass and reforestation. Due to the family planning programme (One Family One Child) , the birth rate has been brought down to 11 per thousand. \xa0The Hiware Bazar Gram Sabha instituted a watershed development programme and imposed a complete ban on water intensive cultivation like sugarcane, banana. Since 2004, Hiware Bazar has been conducting an annual water audit, measuring the total availability of water.', 'Hiware Bazar is now reaping the economic benefits of the developmental schemes. Each village resident earns almost double of most of the country’s rural population.', 'As a result 32 families that had earlier migrated to nearby urban areas of Mumbai & Pune have come back. The process of social integration has led to the formation of Women Thrift groups, Milk Dairy Society, Youth Clubs, Common crematorium facility and numerous other co-operatives.

The sun rises the earliest in India for the people here. The nearby Chinese village of Sama is visible at a distance. It is a harsh terrain, and people are few. Small villages of a few hundred pepole are scattered across the high mountain ranges. Kibitho is in fact north of the town of Walong, after which the bloody battle of Walong is named. At Kibitho in 1962, several members of the Kumaon regiment lost their lives fighting the Chinese.', 'A monument in the memory of the soldiers who laid down their lives reads:', ""\nArunachal Pradesh is not an easy place to live in, if you are human. Neither is it an easy place to live in, if you are a tiger or one of those much sought after wildlife. While human life is easily lost to malaria, wildlife is hunted, often for paying for health care costs. A curious web that weaves the fate of the tiger into the fabric of public health. I happened to see this curious connection first hand in another thickly forested area of Arunachal Pradesh, the Namdapha Tiger Reserve. Kibitho, is however more promising. A sub-centre with a pharmacist and a nurse caters to the circle and nearby villages on the hill slopes. The pharmacy is well maintained by the young pharmacist, stocking all the essential medicines.\nIn an age where rubbishing government services is easy (and legitimate often!), seeing such examples of sincerity and motivation among young health workers in remote sub-centres is heartening.\nA sub-centre is the arm of the first line health services in India. A sub-centre ususally has at least a nurse-midwife – auxiliary nurse-midwife (ANM). She is trained to conduct normal deliveries, provide very basic curative services (give paracetamol for fevers and pains and such) and is the face for the myriad national disease control programmes, that super-educated consultants in swank offices in Delhi/Bangalore/Geneva think will change the world. Much rests on her shoulders. The ANM is expected to maintain at least 18 registers, conduct routine check-ups for all pregnant women in her area, detect ones that may run the risk of a pregnancy-related complication (short stature, increased blood pressure during pregnancy and such), provide family planning services through oral contraceptives, intra-uterine device insertion etc., provide immunisation services, promote breast feeding, provide health education and in general promote healthy living among the people in her catchment area. In addition, several nationally planned and launched programmes such as the successful one for controlling Tuberculosis (the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme) or one of the other failing ones (such as the National Mental Health Programme) compete with each other for her time.\nIt is a ray of hope to see the Kibitho sub-centre. In an age where rubbishing government services is easy (and legitimate often!), seeing such examples of sincerity and motivation among young health workers in remote sub-centres is heartening. And it is not an easy choice to work in such places for most of us ambitious lot. “I heard that the nightlife in Bangalore is great!” a doctor asked me in another PHC in the plains of Arunachal at Bordumsa. “We are still waiting for light at night, forget the life….” she continued.\n\n Staff of Kibitho pose outside their sub-centre\nPharmacist shows his well stocked and maintained pharmacy in India's easternmost village at Kibitho in Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nIt made me wonder, as to what keeps spirits high among health workers in difficult areas. A government doctor in Karnataka, for example chooses poorer salary, uncertain career path, leaking quarters, dull nightlight and an over-populated out-patient department when he sets foot into a primary health centre as a medical officer. Some job satisfaction ahead…..\n\nMy thoughts go to a doctor I met in Gubbi, a small town in Tumkur district in Southern Karnataka. Gubbi Veeranna, one of the well-known theatre personalities from Karnataka who started the first Kannada theatre hailed from here. Historically, the town was well-known for its local markets for cotton and areca nut. As early as in 1871, Gubbi was a municipality of its own. The Imperial Gazetteer of India in 1871 talks of the monthly ‘jaatres’ or fairs which were well known for the sale of cotton cloth, blankets, rice and other articles from as far as Malnad (the mountainous monsoon-fed wetlands to the west) to the dry areas of Rayalaseema and the low hills of Arcot to the east and South. Today, Gubbi is a taluka headquarters in Tumkur district and is one of the ten talukas in the district.\nGubbi is about 20 km from Tumkur and is situated along the highway to Honnavar from Bangalore, that passes through Tumkur. The taluka hospital of Gubbi is along the highway passing through the town. The Administrative Medical Officer, the doctor in the hospital tasked with managing this hospital is Dr. Dani. The hospital was a Community Health Centre earlier with 30 beds being upgraded now to a 100 bedded hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Dani\n\nDani is one of the participants of the capacity-building programme organised by IPH and its partners in Tumkur. Dani is a paediatrician by training with three decades of experience. He is today managing a 100 bedded Taluka hospital. His hospital sees over 200 patients in a day, is severely understaffed and morbidly overloaded. In these days of panchayati raj, he is answerable not only to his superiors in the hallowed chambers of the directorate in Bangalore, but also to the representatives of the people in the narrow chambers of the Gubbi Taluk Panchayat.\nThe hospital provides out-patient services to nearly 300 people in a day. At a time when there is a beeline towards corporate hospitals and having busy evening practices, it is heartening to see Dani and his colleagues in Gubbi hospital providing services within the constraints they face; and these are many. Dani conducted a study in his hospital to understand patient satisfaction, as it bothered him that most of the people obtaining the services at Gubbi hospital were reporting that they were not happy with the services. Was there truth to this?\nDani approached it very scientifically. He did not take this for granted. Nor did he cursorily conclude on the reasons for patient dissatisfaction. He conducted a study consisting of exit interviews of through a structured questionnaire. Patients were recruited into the study randomly. He considered the following aspects in his questionnaire:\n\nStaff availability for patients\nBasic amenities like toilets, drinking water, ambulance services and drug availability\nPatient safety in hospital – infection control, physical safety of women and children\nPerceptions of cost\nAdministrative and procedural problems\n\nThe questionnaire confirmed his hunch about dissatisfaction. Presenting the results in Tumkur, Dani also shared the possible reasons for this. On an average, each doctor in his hospital sees over 70 patients in a day. Many of these, of course are specialists who are supposed to be giving a lot more time than they can to these patients that are referred from primary health centres. However, these patients needing specialist care are clouded by many others who come here for routine health problems. There is no referral system in place.\nDani in his study prepared hospital performance indicators for all departments – in-patients, specialities, CSSD etc. He identified issues in human resources, infrastructure and a few other issues as key reasons for the patient dissatisfaction. He found that staff motivation was poor. Also, he was working in a severely understaffed hospital. Recruitment to the hospital happen in Bangalore. While it is easy to upgrade the beds from 30 to 100, finding the requisite support staff and motivated doctors to work here is another story. The district is helpless to fulfill existing vacancies. In addition, he found that supervision was poor. The doctors and other senior staff could hardly devote time to supervise and hand-hold their non-clinical team. Where is the time for management of the hospital?\nIn addition to doctors not being available in good numbers, the amenities provided were also poor. Residential quarters were not available for all the staff. The hospital lacked good water and sanitation facilities. A reception counter itself was not there.\nThis was of course a small study done in a small taluka hospital, one among over a hundred taluka hospitals in the country. However, the issue Dani identified for his study, ‘patient dissatisfaction’ is a universal phenomenon in public health services in the country today. In India today, irrational health practices and expensive health care is becoming a feature rather than a problem. Government-provided health services is the lifeline for millions of poor, who depend on these, and for whom health expenditure is often catastrophic. The reasons Dani identifies through his study are also quite representative of hundreds of other taluka hospitals.\nDoctors in government services work with many constraints. Staff are demotivated. There is always pressure from elected representatives, sometimes justified, and other times not. Teamwork is lacking and the work environment is not always cheerful or fulfilling. Yet, there are people such as Dani in many of the small hospitals in the country, whose toils go unheard, and whose stories go unsaid. Yet, we often see the glamour and glory that many a corporate hospital catering to a much smaller proportion of people get.\n\nAn old woman walks out of the Pattanayakanahalli PHC in Tumkur district of Karnataka. PHCs are the first line health services for most of the rural poor.\n\nHere is a doctor who in the middle of taluka meetings, trainings, reviews and visits by superiors, also manages a busy clinic as a paediatrician and is expected to manage a 100-bedded hospital for a taluka. In the midst of this, he keeps his spirit alive and did a study to understand and document patient dissatisfaction. We hope that Gubbi finds more specialists and most importantly, committed people like Dani.\nBoth the team at Kibitho and the doctor in Gubbi reinforce my hope in our health services. At the recently concluded National Conference on Bringing Evidence into Public Health Policy, Amarjeet Sinha, a senior secretary in the Government of India, who has been steering the National Rural Health Mission noted in his speech the difference he saw in PHCs in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. As he drove through the state, he was surprised to see the number of buldings in Karnataka – empty ones.\nYes, in Karnataka, with technical assistance from World Bank, several buildings – PHCs, hospitals and such were constructed. While several states in the country reel under poor infrastructure, in Karnataka, political pressure, poor planning and World Bank assistance has together created a plethora of buildings. Well painted, equipped and unused. He continued to underline the importance of job satisfaction for the employees. With clearer career pathways, better salaries and a robust cadre of public health that manages the health services, Tamil Nadu has prioritised people’s health….whatever may be the cost. After all, wasn’t health supposed to be a fundemental right or is it wrong to say that?\nIn Karnataka and in several other states, on the other hand, PHCs are poorly staffed, poorly supplied and provide very poor quality health care, if at all. It is under these very circumstances that people like Dani and the team at Kibitho function. Our health workers are our unsung heroes. I look forward to the day when states in India realise that it is not so much the lack of training or buildings that plague our health services, but merely the lack of an environment in which our health workers can deliver better.\nDr. Dani is now transferred out to another taluka hospital.\nThis article written by Dr. Prashanth N S.

There is even less a local can hope to see. Yet, some wonders need no trumpet blows, no billboard signs. The right traveler finds his way to these silent standing monuments, set against a backdrop that is much more humongous and yet, fairly small.', 'In the heart of Central Delhi, where half the city rushes to work and the other half lazes around in Cafés or tea-bars, Agrasen ki Baoli (step well) comes as a sweet surprise on a hot summer afternoon. It is a perfect place to steal a quiet moment from your busy lives, to experience a moment’s stand still and catch a breath to just let the massiveness take you over in its stride. It is a juncture between the past and the future, a moment entirely yours, unadulterated by any influences, to truly define life just how it is. No exaggerations. No understatements.', 'Life in Delhi is incomplete without visiting these step wells, these humble structures built in magnificent glory by the successive rulers of Delhi.\xa0Carved profusely,\xa0Agrasen ki Baoli, a 60 meter long and 15 meter wide structure, has low chambers that provide the much needed respite from Delhi heat. To add to it, the flocks of lively pigeons taking flight are a remarkable sight in an otherwise stone structure. One can easily watch these birds all day long. They seem to be weaving a story of their own.', 'What is fascinating about step wells is how long they have existed.\xa0Stepwell construction is known to have gone on from at least 600 AD. It is India’s unique architectural marvel. In fact, India is also proud of being home to the world’s deepest step well, the 35 meter deep Chand Baori in Abhaneri\xa0near Jaipur in Rajasthan.', 'In ancient times,\xa0Baolis represented a feeling of community, of oneness especially for women, for whom fetching water would be the only activity they could independently pursue. For the women, the\xa0baolis offered an ephemeral sense of freedom. With the British rise to power in India in the early nineteenth century, the opposition to step wells became more pronounced. The installation of rural taps became a top priority of the Raj.', 'While finding step wells in an urban setting might have sparked an initial surprise, on second thoughts it is only logical. Managing and mediating water resources was critical even in ancient times, especially in the rapidly growing cities. Then again, climbing up and down the\xa0baoli steps offers health benefits of its own (especially for city dwellers)! The cities have much to derive from these monuments – A glorious past, a proud present and a sustainable future.\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', ""Co-Founder of Serene Woods portal for authors and photographers, I have authored two books - 'Drenched Soul' (poetry) and 'If At All' (fiction).

Police case files are overflowing with murders, rapes and assaults. The capital city of Delhi is shamed by statistics of one rape every twenty-four hours, to say the least. The question of safety of women in Delhi has caught the attention of media and the common citizen once again. And it is only one of the several questions facing the society today. In such circumstances, it is very difficult to find a ray of hope. Yet, the pillars of our society continue to stand, only with the support of some noble men and women, whose work speaks for itself.', 'Swanchetan, an organisation started in 1998, stresses the importance of mental health for the overall well being of the society. While no entity can directly take the judiciary into its own hands, Swanchetan facilitates justice for traumatized victims by providing them the emotional support and the courage necessary for voicing their pain, anguish and suffering so as to give them adequate representation in the court of law. Thanks to the efforts of Swanchetan, nearly eight thousand survivors and their families have been provided trauma counselling. Swanchetan stands for the dignity and rights of all survivors, who are victims of or witness to trauma ranging from sexual assault, child abuse, relationship violence, trafficking, ethnic violence and terrorism.', 'Swanchetan has initiated four key programmes – Crisis Intervention, Research and Advocacy, Rehabilitation and Survival and Training and Workshops. What is unique about Swanchetan is that apart from giving strength to victims, it also counsels the perpetrators of crime, thus dealing with the problem in its entirety.', 'Swanchetan started ten years ago when the founders witnessed a family at a police station unable to hold their grief because their child had been murdered. Timely grief counseling helped them to give a coherent account of the events, take charge of their lives and helped in the identification of the offender. Dr. Rajat Mitra, Director and Co-Founder, Swanchetan discusses the motivation behind it, “We were concerned about how poor and marginalised people did not have access to immediate support and help, to be able to justify in court. We were motivated by a desire to work for the poor, to work for those suffering from deep trauma and for the community in general. A series of events at police stations and hospitals inspired us to take the cases of helpless victims forward. Victims often share things with us that become part of the police records and courts when we testify on their behalf. We also help victims, who are scared to go to the police by helping them file a complaint. This facilitates the process of justice.”', 'Dr. Mitra’s personal experiences have contributed greatly to the way he serves the society. During his later years in school, he spent a great deal of time with a friend whose house was open to men and women with mental illness who had no place to go. He was hence exposed to these problems early on in his life and decided to study psychology and become a doctor. He has immense passion for victim care and has even served in refugee camps of Gujarat and Kashmir, two states rife with violent disturbances.', 'Dr. Mitra is renovating the existing system at three levels. At the community level, he educates victims and their families on their rights, various avenues for recourse, and available resources for help and healing. At the law enforcement level, he trains police to use humane methods when questioning victims of crime. At the policy level, Dr. Mitra is advocating for legal recognition for the rights of victims in India.', 'The impact of such a movement can only be felt in the way it has lent a renewed hope of a dignified life to the traumatized, who otherwise might never have recovered from the shock of a heinous crime.\xa0 Amongst these is the rehabilitation of several survivors of sexual trafficking in the community. One such survivor Rita [name changed] was once working as a courier for a criminal gang and working as a child prostitute.\xa0 Swanchetan fought for her rights and testified for her in the court against her perpetrators which resulted in their sentencing and Rita being entrusted to the care of the organization. Five years later, Rita is working in a garment firm having an independent income and above all, a life she can feel proud of. Is there a better way to build a better society, than by taking care of those who need our help the most, when they need it the most? I think not.', 'Read about the impact of Swanchetan at http://www.swanchetan.org/Default.aspx', 'To view the complete image gallery, go to http://www.swanchetan.org/ImageGallery.aspx?AlbumId=9&ImageId=93\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', ""Co-Founder of Serene Woods portal for authors and photographers, I have authored two books - 'Drenched Soul' (poetry) and 'If At All' (fiction).

You see a happy face. The image of a child flashes across one’s mind as that of a happy, carefree, innocent face with sparkling eyes. It conjures up a picture of a dreamlike life. But what if this picture suddenly fades away, ruthlessly replaced by a child lying in the mud, unfed and uncared for, breathing dust filled air and not knowing whom to call out for help? Thousands of children of construction workers today lead such an unnatural, inhuman life, as they struggle to survive. How can their lives be cared for?', 'Mobile Crèches with their vision of all children to have a nurturing and happy childhood and the mission to promote ‘child-friendly sites’, is working towards a future where every child living on a construction site is safe, healthy and educated, and able to enjoy their childhood. It is a mammoth task, but certainly not impossible.', 'Mobile Crèches was founded by Meera Mahadevan in 1969 in Delhi with the belief that every child has the fundamental right to security, education, health care and protection. A housewife at the time, she was passing a construction site when she was struck by the sight of a baby lying unattended and exposed to the harsh heat. The next day, she set up a tent, hired some help and started the first Mobile Crèche. This initiated a social movement whose guiding principle was – Early Childhood Matters.', 'In April 2007, after over three decades of working as one organisation, Mobile Crèches has split into three separate entities – Mobile Crèches (Delhi), Mumbai Mobile Crèches and Tara Mobile Crèches (Pune). Devika Mahadevan, a member of the Board of the Mumbai Mobile Crèches has been officially associated with the movement for five years. The former CEO explains, “My grandmother Rukmini Mahadevan was instrumental in setting up the movement in Mumbai. In fact she had also roped in my other grandmother and my father, who was on the Board too. The movement is special because there is no other organisation especially catering to the migrant population on construction sites. Their problems largely remain ignored. Now that education has been declared a right and every child above the age of six should be sent to school, we feel that we can act as facilitators and give these children of labourers and migrants a better future. One of the initiatives we started was to train women on construction sites to become teachers. Presently we have 28 centres in Mumbai and 40% of our teachers are from the construction sites. Our in-house training programme provides 11 months of on the job training to these women.”', 'Founded on the principle of ‘Early Childhood Matters’, the Mobile Crèches has developed a comprehensive day care service programme that meets children´s emotional, physical, cognitive and social development needs, and has pioneered the first Early Child Care Education (ECCE) programme for migrant workers´ children in this country. Over the past four decades they have worked in close partnership with parents, the construction industry, labour communities, government agencies and concerned NGOs to promote child rights.', 'Devika adds, “We have a special programme for children below 3 to make sure they are healthy. Then we also have preschool activities and health nutrition simulation. We also try to send students to municipal schools after a certain age. A survey revealed that we have children from 17 different states on one site and hence, language becomes a big barrier for these students when mainstreaming. However, they can pick up the language rather comfortably as they are still in their learning years.”', 'Mobile Crèches believes that learning starts at birth and continues through pre-school and formal schooling to equip the child for life. In the year 2007-8, they reached 5000 children, in 08-09, they reached 5500 children and in 09-10, they reached over 6000 children. Devika shares her future plans and hopes to keep the expansion plans going. At the same time, she hopes to work more closely with government departments to champion the cause of the organisation. Children on construction sites might have to overcome many more hardships than the others but they too, truly deserve the same opportunity. Thanks to the Mobile Crèches, their future is in safe hands!', 'Read more at http://www.mumbaimobilecreches.org/\n\n\n\nFrom TBI Shop\n\n\n\n', ""Co-Founder of Serene Woods portal for authors and photographers, I have authored two books - 'Drenched Soul' (poetry) and 'If At All' (fiction).

Mehta and Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Museums']","['\n\n\nby\n\nAnuradha Parekh\n\n\nDecember 1, 2010, 7:54 am \n\n\n', 'If you happen to be in Ahmedabad, do make it a point to visit two nondescript but absolutely marvelous museums called the N.C.Mehta Museum and Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Museum of Art and Archeology. The former houses rare gems of miniature paintings while the latter has a spellbinding collection of sculptures dating all the way back to a couple of years BC!', 'Housed in the Gujarat University campus, the museums are not very well-known, especially by local auto drivers. But the effort to find them will be well rewarded. The N.C Mehta museum displays some of the finest examples of the lost art of painting miniatures, especially from the regions of Gujarat and Rajasthan where it was most prevalant. There are also a lot of samples of “Pahari” art which would be from the hilly regions of Himachal extending up to Kashmir. The south however never took much to the art form and the furthest reach was up to Belgaum.', 'While many of the miniatures depict religious scenes, some of the most beautiful and intricate among them following Krishna and his various travails with Radha and other Gopikas, there are also a lot that focus on the lives of the Kings of those times. It is a very informative and at times shocking portrayal of the manners and demeanours (or perhaps misdemeanours, depending on how you look at it) of those Kings and their courtesans. In one instance, a Mughal king of the era is shown “fondling young boys” as the English caption bluntly states, while the Hindi caption makes no such claim, though the scene is plain to see. Lovemaking seems to be quite a passion of the times, from what a lot of paintings seem to convey. However, every subject has been handled with utmost perfection and attention to detail, with amazing interplay of colour and intricacy. It is also interesting to note the subtle differences in styles between all the various ages and various regions from where the collection has been amassed.', 'In contrast is the L.D.Museum next door, where the art form is large and imposing, but just as intricate. Available on display are sculptures in stone, bronze and wood, seventy five thousand manuscripts on palm leaf and paper, paintings on cloth and and ancient coins. The statues date back several centuries BC and include several images of Hindu Gods, Buddha and Jain Tirthankaras from all over the country (rather, the various empires that existed back then). Of particular note are the large head of Buddha from around 3rd century BC, a rare small figure of Ganga from Mathura dating back to 4th century AD and a Vijnaptipatra which is a ‘letter of invitation’ painted as a scroll on cloth which refers to the Mughal emperor Jehangir’s lost firman prohibiting the killing of animals in his kingdom during the Jain festival of Paryusana.', 'Unfortunately we do not have any pictures to show as photography is not allowed inside the premises. However, take our word that the two museums are a treasure chest of historical fact and knowledge in a well-kept and well-displayed form and one of the best-kept secrets of Ahmedabad. We hope that the museum authorities are able to keep up the good work they are doing and encourage all of you to definitely pay a visit when you find yourself in that part of the world. It will be time well spent.', 'Here is a Google map to help you locate the museums:\nView Larger Map', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
