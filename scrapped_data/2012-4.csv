You could spend hours observing and photographing these beautiful creatures, fast disappearing in our urban settings. One tip: Go soon, April-May is the Butterfly Season. You can also learn how to start your own little butterfly garden at home!', 'For those who want to see the spectacular sight of hundreds of butterflies flitting around hundreds of flowers, there are two options.', 'Make a long journey to Singapore, Malaysia or Madagascar. Or make a short one to Thane (near Mumbai) and 10 kms beyond on Godbunder Road till you reach a nondescript village called Ovale.', 'In Ovale, you will find Ovalekar Wadi, a 2-acre farm that attracts over a 100 species of butterflies like a green magnet. In this ‘open farm’ (most butterfly gardens including the ones mentioned above are enclosed inside gigantic nets), you will find butterflies that descend from the eastern side of Sanjay Gandhi National Park looking for food plants and nectar plants. And Ovalekar Wadi offers them a veritable buffet because every single plant and tree here has been handpicked for a single purpose: It has to be of some use to butterflies!', 'How did a paddy field turn into a butterfly garden? ', 'The Ovalekars have been living in this Wadi for four generations. After they gave up paddy cultivation a decade ago, the farm started wearing a deserted look. Meanwhile, Rajendra Ovalekar, the youngest in the family, took up a job as a school teacher and moved to Thane City. The farm kept drawing him back as he had a keen interest in the birds and the bees and the insects that frequented the place. Once in 2004, he attended a programme that changed his life and the life of his Wadi. It was called Breakfast with Butterflies and was organized by BNHS (Bombay Natural History Society). In the audio-visual presentation, there were two sections. One was an introduction to the various species of butterflies, and the other section was on the plants and trees that attract butterflies. To his joy, he realized that some of these plants and trees were already there in his Wadi, and he vowed to get the rest of them planted there.', 'Rajendra was encouraged by none other than the father of butterfly watching in India, Isaac Kehimkar. Under his watchful eyes, and over the next 7 years, Rajendra went on a planting spree. He not only planted trees and plants and weeds (yes, weeds too attract butterflies!), but also ruthlessly removed those that were of no consequence to them. And today there are over 5,000 such plants and trees here, spread across 180 species, each of which is used as a food plant or a nectar plant.', 'The result is a plethora of butterflies of all colours and hues, each one with a strange-sounding name: Gaudy Baron, Striped Tiger, Swordtail, Bluebottle, Commander, Common Crow, Wanderer, Crimson Rose, Monkey Puzzle, Grass Demon, etc.!', 'As he took us around, Rajendra explained how to observe butterflies and even photograph them from close quarters. They are ideal candidates, he said, for lazy nature lovers. Unlike birds, they don’t get up with the sun. They get up two hours later. Since they are solar-powered, they have to wait till the sun is truly up and about. So they reach the Wadi around 9. That’s when they are most approachable. Then they become increasingly hyper, and by noontime they are thoroughly exhausted and rest in the shade. Interestingly, smaller butterflies choose smaller flowers and the bigger ones choose bigger flowers. Ample proof that at least in Nature, size does matter.', 'When Rajendra spotted a Tawny Rajah, he clapped like a child and told me to take a photograph. He advised me to have the camera in ‘shoot position’, so that I don’t make a sudden movement by lifting the camera and scaring the butterfly. Then he told me to move towards the butterfly, one step at a time, clicking a photograph at every step. Now he said, depending on my luck, and its mood, it may allow me to get ‘up close and personal’. At the end of the session, keep the best and delete the rest!', 'At the Interpretation Centre in the Wadi, there were photographs and descriptions of various butterflies and moths, to initiate the greenhorns. The best way to start the delightful pursuit of butterflying as Isaac calls it, is to learn to identify a few, and then you start seeing them everywhere, and you wonder how come you didn’t see them all these years!', 'As we stepped out of the Centre, we witnessed one of Nature’s most amazing miracles. On a lime tree, a butterfly was emerging from its pupa. A wet, rolled up butterfly came out of its cocoon, and slowly like a flower it blossomed in front of our eyes. As the morning sun dried up its glistening wings, it must have felt an unbearable lightness of being, and it flew away into the distance in slow-motion. I was told that the lifespan of a butterfly is just 2 to 4 weeks, and as if to make up for the lack of time, some of them start looking for a mate as soon as they are born! That left me wondering whether this newborn had gone looking for a mate, or for food, or just to find its own place in the sun!', 'Choose a spot that has at least 3 to 4 hours of direct sunlight. Ensure you don’t use any insecticide, pesticide or chemical fertilizer. Pesticides can wipe out the caterpillars and the butterflies that visit your garden. Make sure you have 3 to 5 numbers of a particular plant, and keep them in a cluster. Be willing to accept ‘ugly-looking’ plants. Because if a butterfly lays eggs on your plant, its caterpillar will devour every single shoot, leaf, bud and flower, and make your plant look really miserable! But don’t worry, Nature will take its course and your plant will automatically regenerate. Choose from the following (remember, more the merrier!): Marigold, Mussaenda, Red or Yellow Lantana, Crossandra or Aaboli, Pink Ixora, Bryophyllum, Periwinkle or Sadaaphuli, Curryleaf Plant, Lime Plant, Poinsettia, Indian Labernum or Amaltas, Oleander or Kaner, Bamboo, Fan Palm, Areca Palm, the list is endless.', 'There are over 18,000 species of butterflies in the world, 1501 in India and over 140 in amchi Mumbai alone. If we manage to attract at least a dozen of them to our own private butterfly garden, in our balcony or terrace or window-sill, or in our housing society compound, we would have done our small bit to conserve this wonderful world of butterflies. Happy butterflying!', 'Once you reach Thane, take the Godbunder Road. 10 kms from Thane, on the left is Ovale Village.', 'There are two butterfly seasons. The first one is from the first week of March to the second week of May, and the second season is from the second week of September to the second week of November.', 'Ovalekar Wadi is open to visitors only on Sundays, from 8 to 2, for a nominal fee. For bookings, call Rajendra on +91\xa09820779729.', 'A camera and a pair of binoculars. And of course the “Butterfly Bible”: The Book of Indian Butterflies by Isaac Kehimkar.

1,2012-4,"['Archives', 'Brick By Brick, Grain By Grain, Gyarsi Bai And Team Stock Up Against Starvation']","['The sun is about to set in Sunda village in Kishanganj block of Baran district that lies in southeast Rajasthan, on the border with Madhya Pradesh. A group of men and women dig the earth with spades on a small plot at one end of the village. They are Sahariyas, categorised by the government as a ‘primitive’ tribal group, hard at work on a self-initiated special project: A grain bank for their community. ', 'In Sunda village of Kishanganj block, Gyarsi Bai Sahariya, a community activist and local NGO worker, has got together with other villagers to set up their first grain bank. (Credit: Anumeha Yadav\\WFS)\nThe elders in the group describe why these families decided to do ‘shram daan’, volunteer and pool their labour, to build this grain bank. “It will enable us to not only guard against hunger but also give us freedom to choose our livelihood,” says Gyarsi Bai Sahariya, who works with the Jagrut Mahila Manch, a local non-government organisation, to organise tribal women in Baran. “Once it is there, we will neither have to worry about irregularities in public rations, nor will we have to depend for food on rich landlords,” she adds. ', 'Gyarsi Bai, 49, was born into a poor landless family in Faldi village, a few kilometres from Sunda. She became active in organising the Sahariyas, especially women, after she came into contact with Charumitra Mehru and Moti Lal, activists of the Lok Jumbish programme, in 1992. She joined them in encouraging her community women to send girls to school.', 'Over the years she has mobilised Sahariyas to fight for their dues under the public ration system and mobilised them to join campaigns for Right to Information and employment guarantee. “Because many of us did not go to school, landlords try to cheat us out of our rights and our land. Even to get ration cards we have to sit in ‘dharnas’ (sit-in protest) in Jaipur and Beawar,” says Gyarsi Bai, who led community meetings in Sunda to plan the building of the grain bank.', 'Baran district, and particularly the Sahariya families living here – concentrated largely in the two blocks of Kishanganj and Shahabad – have come to national attention because of several hunger deaths over the last 12 years. The death of 47 Sahariyas because of starvation during the 2001 drought even triggered a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court on the right to food. Hunger deaths have been reported as recently as in 2004 and again three years ago in 2009. ', 'It’s not like Baran is a completely arid area. In fact, the land here is fertile and supports two to three crops a year – mustard, cotton, wheat, or gram. More than tough terrain or harsh climatic conditions, it is the Sahariyas’ landlessness and feudal relations with primitive methods of production prevalent in these parts that have made them vulnerable to poor nutrition and starvation.  ', 'Sahariyas have been the focus of several government schemes since the 1960s but most are patchily implemented. They lost their traditional access to timber, gum, and mahua over time as large swathes of the deciduous forests in Baran disappeared. Of 1,030 land claims submitted in Kishanganj and Shahabad blocks since the Forest Rights Act 2006 came into force, the government has distributed land in 354 cases, a little over a third. ', '“Traditionally, we were not agriculturists. Over the years, we lost whatever small landholdings we had, to rich local landlords,” explains Gyarsi Bai, describing how Jat and Sikh landowners, who migrated to Baran from Punjab in the 1970s, gradually consolidated landholdings there. Hundreds of Sahariya families now work as ‘halis’, or bonded labourers, for the same landlords. They have worked without wages for years, in some instances over two and three generations. ', 'This tribal group is entitled to 35 kilos of food grain every month under the government’s Antyodaya scheme. But many do not have ration cards and some complain of irregularity in getting rations on time. So, many have remained dependant on the landlords. “The landlord would give us 10-15 kilos of wheat once every few weeks, sometimes he would give us Rs 9-15 once a month for small expenses,” says Janaki Sahariya, who worked without wages for landlord Bittiya Singh in Sunda village for four years, against a bonded debt of Rs 20,000. ', 'A struggle for freedom against these feudal practices began among the Sahariyas of Baran in November 2010 after the government agreed to release 16 families working as ‘halis’, who gave testimony at a ‘dharna’ for minimum wages under the MGNREGA at Jaipur. Since then 145 Sahariya families have been freed after the district administration waived off their bonded debt. Moreover, the state government has initiated a land survey in the district to redistribute land.', 'Today, the Sahariya families of Sunda village are making an effort to set themselves free from the curse of starvation, too. They say the setting up of the grain bank is an important intervention in this regard. It is necessary for them to be able to ensure they remain food secure irrespective of the state’s support or the landlords’ beneficence. ', 'We have already pooled five quintals of wheat, which we have been collecting over the last year from a portion of the public rations that we are entitled to. It is stored at the anaganwadi temporarily. Over the next two to three weeks we will build the grain bank with our labour', 'says Babulal Sahariya, who worked without wages for 12 years for a landlord against a bonded debt of Rs 45,000. ', 'In mid-January 2012, local landlords raised objections to their choice of land, claiming that it is forest area. However, records revealed that it was revenue land and the district officials have given the project a go-ahead.', 'The 40 Sahariya families of Chainpura, a tiny hamlet in Sunda, have chalked out in detail the norms that will govern the grain bank’s functioning. “Each household will contribute five kilos of wheat to the grain bank every month. Anyone would be able to take food grains as long as they replenish the stock adding a kilo for each month of borrowing,” elaborates Gyarsi Bai. Hemraj Sahariya and Swaroop Sahariya, both in their late teens, who are literate and were working as ‘halis’ until last year, have been appointed to keep basic accounts. “I can sign my name and count till 100,” Hemraj smiles, sitting at one corner of the 17 x 9 feet plot. Construction is now almost complete and the Sahariyas expect to start using the grain bank in a few days.', 'Says Gyarsi Bai, with satisfaction, “When we fled from the landlords’ farms, our biggest concern was where will we get food from now that no landlord will employ us. By pooling together five kilos of wheat each, we are no longer worried about going hungry.” ', 'Following these families’ protracted struggle against being kept as bonded labourers, the Rajasthan government has entitled Sahariya families to 200 days of work under MGNREGA, twice the national norm. And they have begun some additional savings as well. “Some families have also started a ‘marriage fund’, putting together Rs 100 from their wages to tide over credit for consumption needs such as wedding ceremonies,” says Moti Lal, an activist with a local NGO, Sankalp, and a member of the bonded labour vigilance committee set up by the district administration last year. The women organised into three savings groups, and the men into four savings groups, pool in money from their MGNREGA and other daily wage work every week and deposit it in a bank account. ', 'Freedom from bondage; freedom from hunger; freedom from malnutrition – Saharaiya women like Gyarsi Bai are looking for ways to break out of their “starved” existence. Setting up a grain bank is a great first step. ', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"
2,2012-4,"['Archives', 'TBI Travel: Orchha – A Little Known Jewel in The Heart Of India']","['\n\n\nby\n\nSaurabh Chauhan\n\n\nApril 16, 2012, 5:41 pm \n\n\n', 'TBI Guest Writer Saurabh Chauhan travels to Orchha, a quaint little place with an odd name and breathtaking architecture, and learns many interesting versions of historical facts, folklore and myths with a uniquely local flavour.', 'Our visit to a non-descript little temple town, established by a man whose other, rather unsung claim to the pages of history was that he died when attempting to save a cow from a lion, happened through a combination of happy coincidence and the formidable state of Madhya Pradesh’s roads.', 'My brother was on ‘temporary duty’, or “TD” as they refer to it in Air Force parlance, in Gwalior at the time and it seemed like the perfect time to drive down from Delhi to pay him a visit. We, my girlfriend and I, gave in to all the lovely Madhya Pradesh State Tourism Corporation adverts and decided to roll the veritable die and go observe “Hindustan ka Dil” at close quarters.', 'On a cool September morning, in a most unsuitably coloured –black- (as we only discovered later) Alto, we headed down to Gwalior.', 'The itinerary had been drawn up by us (well, mostly me) and the usual suspects were all there; Khajuraho, Bedaghat, Bhopal, Bhimbetka and Sanchi. When planning the trip I had wrestled with the idea of driving from Gwalior to Khajuraho in a single day, some 300km plus. But after having heard the not so lovely things about Madhya Pradesh roads, it was decided that a buffer was needed between Gwalior and Khajuraho and a search commenced.', 'Jhansi was the obvious choice; huge fort, grand history, its rather elaborate set of myths and legends and ofcourse the crowning jewel – Laxmi Bai. However this was rejected outright on the consideration that this was supposed to be a Madhya Pradesh excursion and Jhansi, as all diligent geography students know, is situated in that little deformed arm that U.P. extends into M.P.', 'Shot down, I began the search for a site in the vicinity of Jhansi and that is when I was rescued by a place atleast I had never heard of before – Orchha. Located a mere 20 kilometres from Jhansi and just over the border in the Tikamgarh district of Madhya Pradesh Orchha seemed perfect, atleast to the primary driver on this trip – me.', 'Anticipating Orchha to be the appetiser to the wholesome meal that was to be Khajuraho, we left Gwalior the next morning promising to return after our circumambulation of the heart of India.', 'A mere 140 odd kilometres lay before us that day, so a soothing drive was to be the order of the day. Little did we know that U.P. and M.P. had conspired through the night and placed before us the most god awful patch of road that I have ever experienced in all my time driving around India. Eventually, after several hours of spine shaking and slip-disk inducing roads we reached Orchha. Night had enveloped all sights and the only source of illumination that remained were the headlights of my car and the fireflies that dotted the black canvas of night with their cheery luminescence.', 'At our hotel we were given the option of choosing between a room and a tent. Having already seen the stuffy room with its signature ‘furry’ furniture we ventured to give Spartan living a shot and decided to settle down in a tent. The walk down to the tent was pleasant, the hotel had a little illuminated path laid down across a large lawn and a canopy of twisting, fragrant creepers at the end of which lay the most stunning campsite I have ever seen in my entire life. The tents were laid out in neat little rows along the perimeter of what seemed like a mini-football pitch. Behind the tents was the compound wall of the hotel, right behind which stood the magnificent cenotaphs of Bundela kings and noblemen, set in a site almost overlooking the mighty Betwa River.', 'The illusion of these tombs with their lovely chattris (canopies) dissolving into the water in a warm mix of yellow light from the campsite lamps forms part of perhaps the most incredible backdrop that any hotel room (or tent) has anywhere in world. I remember thinking ‘Wow! This is like having the Colosseum in your backyard’.', 'The evening was spent listening to local artists from Bundelkhand regale us with their haunting music as we swam in the unreal setting of a pool on the banks of the Betwa and at spitting distance from those most hauntingly beautiful tombs.', 'As morning came, we decided it was best to start the exploring early before the sun was higher up in the sky. And off we went.', 'Built in the 17th and 18th Century, the fifteen tombs or rather cenotaphs that stood here were built more as memorials than as places of actual burial. They served the same purpose the pyramids did in Egypt, to glorify the dead; except here there was no treasure, no elaborate boobie traps, no Brendan Fraser and no corpses that could come back to life.', 'The Bundela kings of Orchha honoured members of their clan by erecting these ornate structures along the banks of the Betwa. As I looked at these serene structures I could only marvel at their simple beauty, they weren’t the Taj Mahal but they had their own unique brand of rugged beauty. The Bundela kings may be accused of many things but a lack of aesthetic sense can never be one of them.', 'Kissed softly by the waters of the Betwa, the square-ish cenotaph of Vir Singh Deo was by far my favourite. Here one could spend hours just watching the waters flow lazily by, even as one came to appreciate the undiscriminating unkindness of time.', 'The monument itself, like so many others around India, lies in a state of aggravated disrepair. And it seems here too, that the people and their government have seemingly turned their backs on their own history. It does however, provide a refuge from the heat of the day to wandering cattle, who, perhaps as a tribute to the founder of Orchha, remain loyal companions of his descendent Vir Singh, or atleast companions of his memory.', 'As in life so in death the grandeur of each cenotaph is representative of the status of the person in whose memory it has been erected. From the grandest erected in memory of erstwhile kings to the more humble memorials of a retired Kiledaar (person who guards the fort).', 'Despite the boards declaring them protected monuments under Madhya Pradesh state law, it seems that the only steps taken by the government are to lock the monuments’ gates. Of course these gates have not prevented Mother Nature from reclaiming this lost land as her own and these magnificent monuments exist surrounded by thick foliage. Clearly, no one has read out provisions of the local protection of monuments act to the grass and the trees.', 'After having spent some time staring into nothingness that extends beyond Vir Singh Deo’s tomb, we proceeded towards the main city of Orchha and its twin palaces.', 'Orchha has two palaces – The Raja Mahal and the Jehangir Mahal. Adjacent to each other, these palaces are built in a blended architectural style combining Mughal and Bundela architecture.', 'Our guide – a local boy called Babloo – started our tour with a story about the unusual name of the place itself – Orchha. According to him the founder of Orchha, Raja Rudra Pratap was out on shikaar (hunting) one day when he came upon a small Ram temple in the middle of the forest. Being an austere man he immediately sat down to worship the lord, hands folded and eyes closed. As luck would have it, a wolf picked up the good king’s scent and was nearly upon him while he sat in his meditative state, oblivious, when suddenly a booming voice out of nowhere shouted “Orchha!!” – the chasing command given to dogs in the local Bundela language. And sure enough the hunting dogs that accompanied the kings party were awakened and chased and killed the wolf thus saving the king’s life. Convinced that the command was given by the deity to save his life, Rudra Pratap decided to set up his capital at that very place, around what today is the Raja Ram Temple, and gave it that most peculiar of names – the word uttered from divine lips that saved his life – “Orchha”.', 'The non-esoteric version of the naming of the town has something to with its location which was believed to be secure and “hidden” and that’s what the name means; but let’s not be boring now.', 'The Raja Mahal comes with the usual trappings of any small palace, fountains, dance platforms, bed chambers and wall paintings depicting everything from the ten avatars of Vishnu to the kings’ wives expressed as various body parts of an elephant – you know, standard stuff.', 'The Jehangir Mahal promised to be far more interesting, atleast so far as the story leading up to its construction was concerned. Babloo had this gem to offer by way of explanation – The Jehangir Mahal was built after the then Bundela king invited Mughal emperor Jehangir to Orchha for a nightcap. Of course this invite was extended several years in advance as suitable quarters to house the emperor were required to be constructed if he accepted. The Jehangir palace was a labour of love of the then Bundela king who was a trusted advisor of the Mughal and nearly his BFF (Best Friend Forever).', 'I imagined a dressed up Dilip Kumar (how do you imagine Jehangir?) and a hyper-masculine and moustachioed Vir Singh Deo skipping down the corridors holding hands as he told us this.', 'Eventually the palace was constructed with the usual accoutrements, jewels in walls, naturally air conditioned rooms and drive in elephant facilities. And when Jehangir visited, which he did, it was only for one night, and so impressed was he with the facilities that he promised sovereignty to the Bundela king, his BFF, so long as Jehangir reigned over Delhi. Babloo’s version, while historically inaccurate, does give us an insight into how events in history are turned into myths and perhaps even folklore. Passed down generations they become something that resembles history through rose tinted glasses.', 'Recorded history tells us that Vir Singh Deo, whose cenotaph we saw earlier, was a perpetual thorn in the side of the Mughals. Akbar, tired of his shenanigans sent the young prince Salim to quell this errant Bundela chieftain who dared to stand up against the might of the Mughals.', 'Salim arrived in Orchha and after several battles eventually crushed the Bundela king. In the process Salim also set up an insurance policy for himself; the garrison and palace that came to be known as the Jehangir Mehal. To have his life spared Vir Singh Deo paid the Mughals a tribute in the form of a large portion of his infantry and cavalry. Nonetheless, in 1602, around the time Jehangir ascended to the throne of Delhi, Vir Singh Deo killed the Mughal emissary to his court and was on the run for the remainder of his days. BFF’s indeed!', 'From here Babloo proceeded to narrate the tale of the Raja Ram Temple, the temple constructed by the first Bundela king after his forest epiphany. After the temple was constructed a search for a suitable statue began, artisans were called and asked to produce samples. None was found satisfactory. Then one day Hanuman appeared in the dream of the queen of Orchha and asked her to travel to Ayodhya where she would find the right statue of the God-King. She travelled to Ayodhya and there received a statue from the hands of a holy man who laid only one condition on the transaction; a temple would have to be established wherever she put the statue down first. And as luck would have it, when she got back to Orchha she happened to put the statue down on the plot of land adjacent to the temple already built. And that is why Orchha has two adjacent Ram temples.', 'A lovely bit of folklore I thought, that derives its entire premise from a tale in the Puranas – the story of Ravan and his attempt to carry Shiva in the form of a shivling (phallus form of Shiva) from Kailash to Lanka, which ultimately met with failure with him putting down the shivling in Rameshwaram, Mahabaleshwar, Baijyanath and countless other places, depending on who’s telling the story, and in each of these places a Shiva temple was erected as a consequence. It seemed to me quite poignant how an ancient tale had found a fresh relevance and retelling in this sleepy little place.', 'As a bit of parting trivia Babloo ran up to me and near whispered “Sir, this is the only place in the world besides Ayodhya where Lord Ram is considered the eternal king. The human king is only his regent. That’s why the temple is referred to as the Raja Ram Temple. You take his blessings and he will bless you with a clutch of sons.” Not wanting to risk it with a clutch of sons just yet, we waved goodbye to Babloo and hit the asphalt towards grander temples, greater palaces and more imposing majesty. Madhya Pradesh certainly has some true archaeological gems in its kitty but to me this non-descript town with the curious name will always hold a special place in my heart.', 'Added Trivia: The new “Aam Sutra “ads that have surfaced recently are shot with the Orchha monuments in the backdrop.', 'Get the best positive stories straight into your inbox!']"

Susieben Shah, the founder of Priyadarshini Taxi Service, says that she felt that women empowerment needed to look beyond the conventional ideas of papad or achar making. “There was a twinkle in the eyes of these women when the challenge of becoming a taxi driver was put to them. They want to do something different, something that is a boost to their self esteem”, says Susieben.', 'Priyadarshini’s lady drivers, 20 as of today, come from lower middle class families. At Priyadarshini, the cab fleet, the office staff, the director, the shareholders, the call center personnel – the entire show is run by women. This is indeed big take on the myth that women cannot work together in harmony.', 'The women are interviewed, chosen and given intensive three month training before they wear their pink uniforms as taxi drivers. Their families are interviewed too to make sure that there is family support for these women who would be out on the road for more than 10 to 12 hours in a day. The training, which is given free of cost to the women – thanks to the grant given by the government, is not just about driving. It covers a whole lot of things that will help the women handle their tough job. They learn to maintain the cars, get some knowledge on the tourist attractions in Mumbai to act as a driver cum guide, get equipped with first-aid skills to handle emergencies and learn some self-defense techniques. A crash course on communications skills, basic accounting, etiquette and cleanliness is given along with yoga and meditation classes that will help them handle stress. So at the end of three months, they are confident team of women who are all set for the challenges on the road.\n', 'The streets of Mumbai have seen these lady taxi drivers catching up with their male counterparts since 2008. Since then they have earned the name as the most women friendly service in Mumbai. Women trust them for their safety and families for their comfort and friendliness.\nNow for the obvious question, how safe has it been for the women drivers? It is a tough job, but Mumbai being Mumbai, has been extremely friendly to the lady drivers. They are on the streets during the wee hours of the nights too but nothing untoward has happened. The women say that both the customers and other male taxi drivers have been friendly to them. Public toilets, though Sulabh public toilets have been of great relief, could have been better, says Susieben.', 'Coming from families that have struggled to make their ends meet, these women are able to single handedly earn an income of 10 to 12 thousand rupees a month.

The love and care he showed the birds ensured that their numbers increased year after year as word spread in their home-town! Read and be amazed by the difference ONE man can make.', 'It was from Dr. Asad Rahmani, the Director of Bombay Natural History Society, that I first heard about this legend. His name was Ratanlal Maloo, and he had single-handedly taken care of the conservation of thousands of demoiselle cranes that come to the village of Kheechan in Rajasthan during the months of winter. And for these tireless efforts that spanned over 40 years, he was conferred the Salim Ali Nature Conservation Award in the year 2009 by BNHS.', 'My pilgrimage to meet this soul took me to his 200-year-old house in Kheechan. There, sitting in the shade of a khejri tree outside his house, this septuagenarian told me about his amazing journey.', 'It all began over 40 years ago when his uncle requested him to return from Orissa, where he was working, just to help his lonely mother cross the magical age of 100. Little did Ratanlal know that it was a decision that would change his life, and the lives of thousands of demoiselle cranes.', 'Since Ratanlal had precious little to do in the half-asleep village of Kheechan, his uncle entrusted him with a job: feed the pigeons and sparrows and peacocks that frequent a place at the outskirts of the village.', 'Ratanlal and his newly married wife Sundarbai liked this idea as they were devout Jains who believed that it’s their bounden duty to give alms and to feed birds. Young Ratanlal used to carry a sackfull of grains to the feeding place and his wife used to transfer it into a large vessel and disburse it on the ground at the feeding place.', 'Initially, for a couple of months, only the usual suspects came to feed: squirrels, sparrows, pigeons, and the occasional peacock. But then in the month of September, he found a dozen of a huge, black and white bird that he had never seen before, feeding with the regulars. On asking the villagers, he was told that they were migratory birds that have been frequenting the farmlands of Kheechan in winter. They were called demoiselle cranes or kurja in Rajasthani.', 'It was love at first sight. Ratanlalji started observing them closely. To his joy, he realised that their numbers started growing till it reached around 80 in November. But in February, to his horror all of them disappeared overnight.', 'He had to wait for a year for them to come back. And this time around, there were over 150 of them. Word must have spread in Mongolia and Eurasia that there’s a feast awaiting them in Kheechan, served by this gentle soul called Ratanlal. This number kept on increasing every year, and in the 40 years of his care and conservation, the number became a staggering 15,000 last year.', 'The early days were a struggle for Ratanlal, and the later days a bigger struggle. Once the demoiselle cranes started growing in numbers, the local dogs saw these huge three-foot birds as sitting ducks. They used to pounce upon them, either killing them for meat, or leaving them injured. So firstly, Ratanlal got the panchayat to allot him some land on the outskirts of the village, and he coaxed the richer villagers to help him build a 6-foot fence around what he called the Chugga Ghar or the Feeding Home. He then got a granary made to store the grains that started pouring in from fellow Jain traders who were supportive of the cause. He even got a room constructed to house the injured cranes and bring them back to the pink, nay black and white, of health.', 'To make me understand the scale and the enormity of this simple act of feeding, Ratanlal explained to me the quantity of grains that’s required to feed these birds. What started off as a few innocuous kilos of grains in a year has now become an astromical 1 lakh kilos annually. In peak season today, an average of around 12,000 demoiselle cranes arrive as state guests from November to February. Look at these amazing stats: A thousand cranes need one hundred kilos of grains per day. For 12,000 cranes that’s 12 hundred kilos. For a month that’s 36,000 kilos. For four months, that adds up to over 1,40,000 kilos. At the rate of Rs. 60 per kilo that works out to over 85 lakh rupees per annum! That’s the kind of money that the Jain community spread across the length and breadth of the planet helps him raise every year. It is a quiet cognizance of his selfless service spread over four decades that helped him generate such enormous goodwill.', 'Declared as a World Heritage Site by the World Crane Foundation, Kheechan attracts hundreds of Indians and foreigners who come to witness the spectacle of thousands of demoiselle cranes feeding right in the middle of a human settlement. It was on the terrace of a house overlooking the Chugga Ghar that I met Torbjorn Eriksen, an ornithologist and wildlife photographer from Denmark. He said he had seen many congregations of different species of birds across the world, but never one so dramatic.', 'Torbjorn explained to me the sheer ecological significance of Ratanlal’s act of devotion. Because the cranes get the food they need in the Chugga Ghar, they don’t ravage the farmlands of Kheechan and the surrounding villages, thereby making them more endearing and acceptable to humans. Hence there’s no man-animal conflict here, but rather a heart-warming man-animal coexistence.', 'When I reminded Ratanlal that his guests come all the way from Mongolia and Eurasia, he smiled and said, ‘To me it doesn’t matter where they are coming from, and where they are going. What matters to me is that they have entered my life, and they are here to stay.’', 'As we were sitting near the granary where a tractor load of grains was being unloaded, a farmer came with an injured demoiselle crane, attacked viciously by a village dog. As Ratanlal washed its wounds with care and compassion, I remembered what he had told me a while ago when I had asked him if he had any children. He had said, ‘No, I don’t have any. But no, I do have. I have about 15,000 of them!’', 'Ratanlal explained to me what he had observed in these birds over the years. They spend the night in a salty landscape called Malhar Rinn, about 25 kms from Kheechan as the crane flies. And just before the sun wakes up, they fly to the sand-dunes overlooking the Chugga Ghar. After the entire flock of a few thousands collect on the dunes, they slowly march towards the Chugga Ghar that’s a kilometre away. Here they wait outside the enclosure patiently, for almost an hour. Meanwhile a group of about 30 of them encircle the place, making sure it’s safe to land. Once the leader of this group lands, the entire entourage follows. And then all heaven breaks loose! Waves after waves of these beautiful birds land inside. First the ones that are close to the enclosure, and then the ones that have lined up all the way up to the dunes. But the discipline they show has to be seen to be believed. Though there would be about 4 to 6 thousand of them on any given day, at any given point in time there won’t be more than about 500 of them inside the enclosure. It’s only when the groups inside fly away that the groups outside enter.', 'Ratanlal told me that for many years it was an anonymous leader who used to be the first one to land. But since the last 11 years, there has been a change of guard. The leader now is a crane referred to locally as ‘langda’, as it has a limp leg. He is instantly recognizable as his leg dangles in the air as he hovers around the Chugga Ghar, and then lands on one leg!', 'The demoiselle cranes, after a sumptuous meal, fly off to the two lakes at the periphery of the village: Vijaysagar Lake and Raatdi Naadi. Here they sip the blueness of the lake and then gobble copious quantities of the pebbles that lie on the lakeshores. Ratalal explained the reason for this strange habit. Since the grains they eat are whole grains, these pebbles act as grinding stones and make it easier for them to digest them. Then they have a dip in the lake, and the more romantic among them indulge in ballet-like mating dances. Just before sundown, they call it a day. And fly off to Malhar Rinn to spend the night standing on one leg. This routine continues till March, when one day, without any warning, they fly off to the land of their birth, in the thick of the night.', 'On the 7th of July 2011, Ratanlal too flew away from this world in the middle of the night, just like his feathered friends.', 'Come September, the demoiselle cranes will land in Kheechan, and many of them will miss the hand that fed them for forty years. Perhaps you could go there and lend a hand?', 'How to get there: Take the road from Jodhpur to Phalodi, which is 135 kms to the north. Kheechan is 10 kms to the east of Phalodi. The base could be at Phalodi, or Osian which is on the halfway mark on the Jodhpur-Phalodi Road.', 'Where to stay: Plenty of options at either place.
